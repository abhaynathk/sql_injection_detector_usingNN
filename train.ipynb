      "These are the voices which we hear in solitude, but they grow faint and\n",

      "world. I remember an answer which when quite young I was prompted to\n",

      "Jet makers feud over seat width with big orders at stake\n",
      "A row has flared up between leading plane makers over the width of tourist-class seats on long-distance flights , setting the tone for a bitter confrontation at this month &apos;s Dubai Airshow .\n",
      "The dispute focuses on the width of seats provided on long-haul flights for economy passengers - not always the ones most courted by airlines , but whose allocated space holds the key to efficiency claims for the latest jets offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co .\n",
      "Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would provide for a seat at least 18 inches (46 cm) wide in economy cabins , but its U.S. arch-rival Boeing says it should be for airlines to decide .\n",
      "The dispute comes as plane makers vie to sell ever-larger versions of their twin-engined long-distance aircraft , with potentially record orders expected at the November 17-21 event .\n",
      "How the back of the plane is laid out - particularly whether seating is 9 or 10 abreast - is central to the economic performance claims being made for new &quot; mini-jumbo &quot; jet designs .\n",
      "Boeing says its revamped &quot; 777X &quot; will hold 406 people based on economy seats more than 17 inches wide and set out 10 in each row .\n",
      "Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in 18-inch-wide economy seat laid out 9 abreast .\n",
      "Plane giants often trade blows on technical matters through advertising in the trade press .\n",
      "Now , Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow , where the 777X is expected to dominate with more than 100 orders .\n",
      "It recently previewed what may be the start of a new ad war by showing financiers a slide illustrating three people squashed together at a restaurant , titled &quot; Would You Accept This ? &quot;\n",
      "&quot; Boeing is proposing long-distance flying in seats narrower than regional turbo-props , &quot; said Airbus sales chief John Leahy .\n",
      "As diets change , people get bigger but plane seating has not radically changed .\n",
      "Between the early 1970s , when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul travel , and the turn of the century , the weight of the average American 40- to 49-year-old male increased by 10 per cent , according to U.S. Health Department Data .\n",
      "The waist of the average 21st-century American male is 39.7 inches , according to U.S. health statistics .\n",
      "Airbus says its rival is sticking to a seat concept from the 1950s , when the average girth of the newly christened &quot; jet set &quot; was narrower .\n",
      "Airbus says it has commissioned research suggesting an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 per cent .\n",
      "Boeing disputes Airbus &apos;s figures on seat measurements and says it is not up to manufacturers to step into decisions on how airlines balance fares and facilities .\n",
      "It also says research shows cabin experience depends on more than the width of a seat .\n",
      "&quot; It really comes down to providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do the things that they believe they need to do to be successful , &quot; said Boeing cabins expert Kent Craver .\n",
      "They don &apos;t want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable .\n",
      "They know their business better than anyone else .\n",
      "For flyers it is about more elbow room , but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that could affect earnings .\n",
      "Behind the dispute is a race for plane orders with at least $ 700-billion of estimated business at list prices in coming decades , enough to tip the scales of U.S. and European exports .\n",
      "As Reuters first reported in July , seat layout is exactly what drives the battle between the latest jets .\n",
      "Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 per cent better efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engined long-haul designs than the market leader in that segment , the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER .\n",
      "Boeing &apos;s performance claims depend in part on comparing the 10-abreast 777X with an original 9-abreast 777 design .\n",
      "The gain in unit costs is blunted compared with 10-abreast now in use .\n",
      "&quot; The reason Boeing are doing this is to cram more seats in to make their plane more competitive with our products , &quot; said Kevin Keniston , head of passenger comfort at Europe &apos;s Airbus .\n",
      "On the other hand , analysts say full 10-seat-per-row cabins for existing 777s suggest many passengers are voting for the denser layout , which may go hand in hand with cheaper fares .\n",
      "&quot; Eighteen inches in seat width would be great for passengers , but the reality is that from a business point of the Airbus proposal is driven by the threat of the 777 , &quot; said cabin interiors expert Mary Kirby , founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network .\n",
      "Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but offer a catalogue of suppliers for airlines to choose from .\n",
      "Globe-trotting jet sellers even carry tape measures to check on competing layouts .\n",
      "While boasting comfort , all builders also offer jets with high-density layouts for low-cost airlines and regional travel .\n",
      "Airbus offers a 10-abreast A350 but says it has not yet sold it .\n",
      "Until recently , Airbus was stressing the need for more cabin customization by offering wider aisle seats on some of its jets .\n",
      "Without the support of the only other maker of large modern jets , experts say its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to fly , but could distract from a wave of 777X sales .\n",

      "Report: Obama campaign considered dumping Biden for Hillary Clinton\n",
      "President Barack Obama &apos;s closest advisers secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 ticket , according to the New York Times .\n",
      "The revelation is the most notable bombshell from Mark Halperin and John Heilemann &apos;s heavily anticipated 2012 campaign tome , &quot; Double Down: Game Change 2012 . &quot;\n",
      "The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday evening that the President &apos;s top aides conducted &quot; extensive group-sessions and polling in late 2011 &quot; to gauge whether the dumping Biden could help bolster Obama &apos;s waning re-election hopes .\n",
      "According to the Times &apos; national political correspondent Jonathan Martin , the book provides a thorough account of the effort by senior officials inside the campaign and the White House , namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley , to measure what effect swapping former Secretary of State Clinton for the Vice President would have in the polls .\n",
      "The potential switch was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office .\n",
      "Only half a dozen of the President &apos;s closest advisers -- including Daley , former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina , and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe -- knew the change was under consideration .\n",
      "&quot; Double Down &quot; claims Daley spearheaded the effort to replace Biden , despite their &quot; close personal rapport , &quot; before ultimately deciding against the move when their data showed adding Clinton to the ticket wouldn &apos;t &quot; materially improve Obama &apos;s odds . &quot;\n",
      "In an interview with Martin , Daley confirmed that the administration did in fact consider replacing Biden with Clinton .\n",
      "&quot; I was vocal about looking into a whole bunch of things , and this was one of them , &quot; Daley told the paper .\n",
      "You have to remember , at that point the President was in awful shape , so we were like , &quot; Holy Christ , what do we do ? &quot;\n",
      "While Daley characterized the research as &quot; due diligence , &quot; Martin told CNN &apos;s Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign made a significant investment in finding out whether the move would pay dividends at the polls .\n",
      "&quot; Campaigns don &apos;t spend the kind of money on polling and focus groups unless they &apos;re seriously considering something , &quot; Martin said on AC360 .\n",
      "It &apos;s unclear , however , whether Obama knew his team was exploring the swap .\n",
      "Martin told CNN that he asked Daley whether his then-boss knew about the potential shuffle .\n",
      "While Daley said he doesn &apos;t think the President &quot; was aware &quot; of the potential change , the former chief of staff admitted that it &apos;s &quot; possible &quot; Obama knew .\n",
      "Martin added that &quot; Double Down &quot; does not definitively answer whether the political probing reached Obama &apos;s desk .\n",
      "Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought Obama did not know about the research into dumping Biden from the ticket .\n",
      "&quot; Possibly , &quot; Martin replied .\n",

      "&quot; We want to involve the residents in the planning at as early a stage as possible , &quot; said Mayor Jens Häußler , opening the citizen &apos;s information event regarding the flood protection concept in Gechingen .\n",
      "Around 80 participants came to the Gemeindehalle (community hall) to have the planned measures explained to them , to express their concerns and submit ideas .\n",
      "Häußler made clear: &quot; The final decisions will be made by the members of the Town Council &quot; .\n",
      "Häußler commented that the flood that found Gechingen unprepared on 15 May 2009 , was a decisive event in raising the question of protective measures for the future .\n",
      "A river basin study was commissioned in collaboration with the neighbouring community of Aidlingen , which now forms the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen .\n",
      "&quot; The goal is the protection of as many developed plots of land as possible , &quot; said Häußler .\n",
      "The basis for the plans is the need for protection against expected floods , which statistically occurs every 100 years , according to the German Weather Service .\n",
      "Climate change is taken into account in the form of an allowance of 15 per cent .\n",
      "In expert circles this is referred to as &quot; HQ 100aKlima &quot; .\n",
      "The masses of water that caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 was equivalent to a 1,000-year flood .\n",
      "&quot; There is no such thing as absolute protection , but we can attempt to make a relative improvement , &quot; said Häußler .\n",
      "In order to achieve HQ 100aKlima protection , around four million € must be invested in Gechingen , whereby the town can count on a State subsidy of around 70 per cent .\n",
      "However , Häußler indicated that the funding would only be provided if an overall concept is developed .\n",
      "In order to develop such a concept , the town is reliant on the cooperation of its citizens .\n",
      "A complex planning and approval procedure must be completed .\n",
      "In a best case scenario , implementation could begin in 2016 .\n",
      "Among other measures , the protection concept , which (we reported) has already been presented to the Town Council during the past week , plans local measures in the tributary to the River Irm , running from the Stammheim Valley .\n",
      "In conjunction with the presentation of the flood protection concept , the participants made use of the opportunity to submit their concerns .\n",
      "Among others , the question was raised as to why embankments and detention reservoirs are no longer planned to protect the location .\n",
      "Gregor Kühn , technical planner at the commissioned engineering company , Hügelsheim-based &apos; Wald und Corbe &apos; , who presented the concept , emphasised that it required the interplay of all proposed measures , in order that their sum might achieve the desired goal .\n",
      "Furthermore , the most economic solution must be found , said Joachim Wald of Wald und Corbe .\n",
      "There was resentment among local residents of the old town , who have repeatedly to suffer as a result of the overflowing of the canal network , even during normal thunderstorms .\n",
      "The problem is known to the administrative department and initial measures have already been taken .\n",
      "However , Häußler indicated that the guidelines for canal systems are different to those for flood protection , and these must not be confused .\n",
      "The town is obliged to design the canal network in such a way that it can withstand rainfall events every two to three years .\n",

      "He nevertheless praised the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance which he first raised with the Prime Minister at the beginning of May .\n",
      "&quot; I &apos;m hopeful the federal assistance package will go a long way towards taking the state &apos;s public health system off the critical list , &quot; Mr Wilkie said .\n",

      "For two weeks , there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo , some of the worst skirmishes since a peace deal more than 20 years ago .\n",
      "Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , initially backed by white-ruled Rhodesia and then South Africa &apos;s apartheid government as part of efforts to destabilise the country &apos;s independent government .\n",
      "After a 1992 peace deal , it became an opposition party .\n",
      "Analysts believe the country is unlikely to slide back into full-blown conflict , but recent events have unnerved foreign investors and locals .\n",
      "The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could bring in more than $ 50bn of investment over the next few next years from companies including Rio Tinto , Vale of Brazil , Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the US .\n",
      "The ruling Frelimo party , the dominant political force since 1975 , and Renamo blame each other for the tension .\n",
      "Renamo says the government initiated the latest clashes by launching an attack on its members in Sofala province , traditionally a Renamo stronghold , on October 17 .\n",
      "Assaults on the former rebels then escalated as government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama , the group &apos;s leader , Fernando Mazanga , Renamo &apos;s spokesman , told the Financial Times .\n",
      "The government blames Renamo for triggering the clashes , accusing it of attacking soldiers .\n",
      "President Armando Guebuza has sought to play down concerns about instability .\n",
      "Mr Guebuza told AFP , the French news agency , on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a &quot; loser &quot; who wanted to use &quot; whatever remains of his forces to try to prove that he can impose on the government his own decisions . &quot;\n",
      "Both Frelimo and Renamo insist they want to avoid war .\n",
      "But concerns have grown after Mr Mazanga was quoted as saying Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace accord .\n",
      "He told the FT that he meant the agreement was no longer being respected by Frelimo .\n",
      "&quot; Our vision is to come back to negotiations , but with seriousness , &quot; Mr Mazanga said .\n",
      "Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions fuelled by a series of clashes this year .\n",
      "&quot; It &apos;s two big men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) butting heads together , &quot; said Joseph Hanlon , a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert .\n",
      "Neither of them are good negotiators and neither of them are prepared to make the kind of concessions that are necessary .\n",
      "Renamo , which has been pushing for electoral reforms , had already said that it would boycott municipal elections due in November .\n",
      "Presidential and parliamentary polls are scheduled for next year .\n",
      "Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt of an ailing movement to win concessions and financial spoils from the government .\n",
      "Renamo &apos;s share of the vote has been declining since 1992 , while a newer party , the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) which was formed by a former Renamo member , is expected to improve its showing at the elections .\n",
      "Mr Mazanga says Mr Guebuza - who is due to step down when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country &apos;s democracy .\n",
      "&quot; He does not want multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency , &quot; Mr Mazanga said .\n",
      "It is unclear how much capacity Renamo has , but it has carried out disruptive hit-and-run attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-south highway .\n",
      "Most of the skirmishes have taken place in Sofala province , which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo , but hosts Beira , the port that miners , including Rio Tinto and Vale , rely on to export coal .\n",
      "In June , Rio suspended its use of the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the line .\n",
      "Mr Mazanga was coy when asked about whether Renamo would repeat this threat .\n",
      "Renamo wanted to &quot; warn the international community that things were not going well in Mozambique , &quot; Mr Mazanga said .\n",
      "The instability has added to frustrations with the government , says Fernando Lima , head of Mediacoop , an independent media company , with many people also concerned about corruption , the slow pace of development and a recent spate of kidnappings .\n",
      "&quot; People think the ones responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president , and he should be the one to find solutions for the problems , &quot; he says .\n",
      "Omar Sultuane , a demonstrator , said people just wanted stability .\n",

      "It will make changes in other core subjects next year .\n",
      "In a separate move , Ofqual , the exams regulator , will unveil a shake-up of the structure of GCSEs , with a new grading system and less coursework .\n",
      "Speaking in the summer , Michael Gove , the Education Secretary , said there was a &quot; widespread consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence , &quot; insisting GCSEs would be &quot; more challenging , more ambitious and more rigorous . &quot;\n",
      "Studies show that English schools devote less time to maths - 116 hours a year or three hours a week during term time - than in most countries .\n",
      "By comparison , Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours a year and pupils do around 138 hours in Singapore .\n",
      "While there will be no formal requirement to devote more of the timetable to maths , Coalition sources said the extensive maths GCSE - combined with more weighting for the subject in league tables - was likely to encourage schools to provide extra teaching .\n",
      "The syllabus will place a greater focus on &quot; real world problems , &quot; including financial mathematics .\n",

      "This venue will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year , with the official date set for the last weekend in September , on 27 and 28 September .\n",
      "On the occasion of the Geisingen town anniversary , a new chronicle will also be published .\n",
      "&quot; However , it will not merely be a chronicle of Geisingen itself , but rather a printed work on the Geisingen of today , which now consists of Geisingen , Kirchen-Hausen , Leipferdingen , Aulfingen and Gutmadingen , &quot; said Mayor Walter Hengstler .\n",
      "And the Geisingen of today is also celebrating a birthday in 2014 , as it was in 1974 that the incorporations to form the current region were completed .\n",
      "The new chronicle is to be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new Festival Hall in Geisingen .\n",

      "The deed was drawn up in Kirchen (Hausen), which at the time was the location of the courthouse .\n",
      "Both communities are thus mentioned in the same deed .\n",
      "One reason for choosing 2014 to celebrate the 1,250-year anniversary in this way , is that it also coincides with the 40th anniversary of the Community Reform (Gemeindereform).\n",

      "By a 5-4 vote , the justices ruled the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act &apos;s individual mandate - which requires citizens to buy health insurance by 2014 or else pay a penalty - was constitutional under the taxing power of the government .\n",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the court while Justices Scalia , Thomas , Alito and Kennedy dissented .\n",
      "The court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700 page law , and further held that the health care law &apos;s requirement that states increase Medicaid eligibility or else lose all federal Medicaid funding is not unconstitutionally coercive .\n",

      "According to the statement , the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt .\n",

      "The pensioner told investigators that his mother had travelled to Spain .\n",
      "The officials found this strange and so continued to investigate .\n",
      "It was discovered that the mother and son had lived in the same residence for more than 15 years and that he had cared for her in her final days .\n",

      "The planned covering of the dilapidated house to the rear of the plot was not permitted for safety reasons , as the premises were at risk of collapsing .\n",
      "Alfred Abel , who currently manages the site , arranged the &apos; face-lift &apos; in cooperation with his colleague , Reinhard Domke , from the citizen &apos;s initiative .\n",
      "Before the citizen &apos;s initiative project , a banner with the message &quot; We are in favour &quot; was put up .\n",
      "However , this did little to distract the 20 or so members of the citizen &apos;s initiative from their project .\n",
      "Their motto , on the large billboard stated &quot; We are against unfinished buildings &quot; .\n",
      "In so doing they wanted to point out the danger of even bigger ruins on the Schweizer Wiese - should the huge project one day fail .\n",
      "Chatting with many people passing by the &quot; construction site &quot; , it became clear that many citizens believe the execution of the project would make things much better for the town , although many have the same questions as the citizen &apos;s initiative regarding the scale of the planned project .\n",
      "However , they are beginning to resign themselves as the town continues to stall in providing answers , said a statement from the citizen &apos;s initiative .\n",
      "We have now been told that the public statements made by the Mayor are also having an impact .\n",

      "Founding Chairman Henne reported in depth on the work of the organisation .\n",
      "In 2004 , he visited the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott in Mauritania for the first time .\n",
      "As a result , an important collaboration was developed and the gynaecologist , Hanne , has performed countless operations on several journeys to the location .\n",
      "During the speech , images from the trips were shown on a large screen , in order to give the guests at the anniversary event an insight into the initiatives mentioned .\n",
      "The organisation &apos;s desert vehicle was also shown .\n",
      "It is a former federal border protection vehicle .\n",
      "Rainer Prewo , the former Lord Mayor of Nagold , made the suggestion of equipping this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and , according to Henne , he is now planning to assume an advisory role within the organisation .\n",
      "In 2008 , the Schleeh carpentry company from Baiersbronn built the hospital station in Socogim , a poor district on the edge of the Capital , in the record time of less than one week - free of charge .\n",
      "Henne also mentioned a new mother and child hospital in Nouakchott\n",

      "You learn a great deal working as a doctor in Africa , said Henne , for example that you should slow down to avoid burn-out .\n",
      "Due to the political unrest in the country , it has not been possible to make as many journeys as planned , but for this reason , many local doctors have come to Germany , to sit in on lectures on a variety of topics .\n",
      "In addition , containers with materials are regularly sent to Africa , for example in March of this year when medical devices , medicines , bandaging material , hospital beds and spectacles were sent .\n",

      "Scientists have shed more light on how the movements of a dog &apos;s tail are linked to its mood .\n",
      "Earlier research had revealed that happy dogs wag their tails more to the right (from the dog &apos;s point of view), while nervous dogs have a left-dominated swish .\n",
      "But now scientists say that fellow canines can spot and respond to these subtle tail differences .\n",
      "Prof Georgio Vallortigara , a neuroscientist from the University of Trento , said: &quot; It is very well known in humans that the left and right side of the brain are differently involved in stimuli that invokes positive or negative emotions . &quot;\n",
      "Here we attempted to look at it in other species .\n",
      "He added that just as in humans , for dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for left-handed movement and vice versa , and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions .\n",
      "To find out more about how dogs react to the lop-sided tail wags of other dogs , the researchers monitored the animals as they watched films of other dogs .\n",
      "They measured the pets &apos; heart rates and analysed their behaviour .\n",
      "It will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way , sometimes the other\n",
      "Prof Vallortigara said: &quot; We presented dogs with movies of dogs - either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to get rid of any other confounding issues , and we could doctor the movement of the tail and present the tail more to the left or right . &quot;\n",
      "When the animals saw an otherwise expressionless dog move its tail to the right (from the tail-wagging dog &apos;s point of view), they stayed perfectly relaxed .\n",
      "But when they spotted a tail veer predominantly to the left (again from the tail-swishing dog &apos;s point of view), their heart rates picked up and they looked anxious .\n",
      "Prof Vallortigara said he didn &apos;t think that the dogs were intentionally communicating with each other through these movements .\n",
      "Instead , he believes that they dogs have learned from experience what moves they should and shouldn &apos;t feel worried about .\n",
      "He said: &quot; If you have several meetings with other dogs , and frequently their tail wagging one way is associated with a more friendly behaviour , and the right side is producing a less friendly behaviour , you respond on the basis of that experience . &quot;\n",
      "The researchers say the findings could give owners , vets and trainers a better insight into their animal &apos;s emotions .\n",
      "Dog behaviour expert John Bradshaw , a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol &apos;s school of veterinary science , said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important to canines .\n",
      "Last year a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when looking at a happy dog .\n",
      "And in another research paper from the University of Victoria in Canada , he said: &quot; Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its &apos; tail &apos; was made to wag left rather than right , rather than becoming anxious - the opposite way around to the Italian study . &quot;\n",
      "He said the differences could be because the dogs in the different studies were not fully interpreting the animals in the films or robo-dogs as canines .\n",
      "A study of how dogs responded to real dogs could help , he explained .\n",
      "&quot; While there is considerable evidence from many different mammals that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes , much of the detail still has to be hammered out - and dogs are no exception , &quot; he said .\n",
      "However , given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded , it will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way , sometimes the other .\n",

      "The second person had to be carried .\n",
      "This was not so simple as they also had to negotiate a narrow stairwell .\n",
      "The building , a workshop with integrated stabling for two horses , was not easy to secure .\n",
      "There were large quantities of wood and bales of straw stored inside .\n",

      "That person will receive $ 250,000 to continue their extraordinary work .\n",
      "For 21 years , Georges Bwelle watched his ill father slip in and out of consciousness , traveling to hospitals that weren &apos;t equipped to help him .\n",
      "Jamef Bwelle was injured in a 1981 car accident near Yaounde , Cameroon &apos;s capital .\n",
      "He suffered only a broken arm at first , but an infection developed and spread to his brain , creating a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life .\n",
      "&quot; There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon , &quot; Georges Bwelle said .\n",
      "We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money .\n",
      "Instead , Bwelle spent years escorting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals , getting whatever treatment they could get .\n",
      "&quot; It &apos;s not easy , &quot; Bwelle said .\n",
      "You can leave home at 5 a.m. , running to the hospital to be the first , and you are not the first .\n",
      "There are a lot of patients .\n",
      "Some people can die because they are waiting .\n",
      "The situation hasn &apos;t changed much since Bwelle &apos;s father passed away in 2002 .\n",
      "In Cameroon , there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people , according to the World Health Organization .\n",
      "For comparison &apos;s sake , the ratio in the United States is one doctor for every 413 people .\n",
      "And even if they could see a physician , many Cameroonians couldn &apos;t afford it .\n",
      "Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line , and nearly three-quarters of the country &apos;s health-care spending is private .\n",
      "&quot; The only problem they have is poverty , &quot; Bwelle said .\n",
      "And with poverty , they cannot enjoy their life .\n",
      "Seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer , Bwelle was determined to do something about it .\n",
      "Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have performed 700 free surgeries in the past year .\n",
      "He became a doctor himself , working as a vascular surgeon in Yaounde &apos;s Central Hospital .\n",
      "And he started a nonprofit , ASCOVIME , that travels into rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care .\n",
      "Since 2008 , he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people .\n",
      "Almost every Friday , he and up to 30 people jam into vans , tie medical supplies to the roofs and travel across rough terrain to visit villages in need .\n",
      "Their luck doesn &apos;t always hold out .\n",
      "They &apos;ve had to push vehicles through rivers and mud more than once .\n",
      "But when they arrive , they receive a true heroes &apos; welcome: a feast , singing and dancing , and the best accommodations the community can offer .\n",
      "In these villages , free medical care is truly a cause for celebration , and Bwelle -- with his big smile and boundless energy -- is more than happy to join in the fun .\n",
      "The next morning , the team begins meeting with hundreds of patients .\n",
      "&quot; We are receiving 500 people in each trip , &quot; Bwelle said .\n",
      "They are coming from 60 kilometers around the village , and they &apos;re coming on foot .\n",
      "Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical care .\n",
      "Many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .\n",
      "Others might receive crutches , a pair of donated eyeglasses or free birth certificates -- documentation that &apos;s required for school but that many impoverished families simply can &apos;t afford .\n",
      "In the evenings , the team will do simple surgeries with local anesthesia .\n",
      "Operations are usually done in a schoolhouse , town hall or home; after the procedure , patients get up and walk to the recovery area to make way for the next person .\n",
      "With the group &apos;s generator lighting the operating room and sanitizing equipment , Bwelle and his volunteers work into the early hours of Sunday morning .\n",
      "It &apos;s a backbreaking pace , but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated .\n",
      "&quot; They are beating drums all night to keep us awake and continue our work , &quot; Bwelle said .\n",
      "On Sunday , the team heads back to the city , tired but proud of their work .\n",
      "The group -- a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students -- has performed 700 free surgeries in the past year , and they know that their help can make a world of difference to those they help .\n",
      "One man explained that the free hernia surgery he &apos;d received will allow him to work again .\n",
      "&quot; This will change my future with my family , &quot; the man said .\n",
      "In addition to holding these weekend clinics and working as a hospital surgeon , Bwelle also works nights at private medical clinics around Yaounde .\n",
      "It &apos;s this second job , he said , that funds about 60% of his nonprofit; the rest is covered by private donations .\n",
      "&quot; I &apos;m not sure when he sleeps , &quot; said Katie O &apos;Malley , a second-year medical student from Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer with Bwelle &apos;s group .\n",
      "He is always either at the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns .\n",
      "For medical and nursing students such as O &apos;Malley , who come from the United States and Europe to join Bwelle on his missions , it &apos;s a hands-on opportunity they &apos;d never get at home .\n",
      "&quot; We &apos;ve been able to scrub in on surgeries where we help blot blood away or hold tools for Dr. Bwelle , &quot; O &apos;Malley said .\n",
      "That &apos;s not something you &apos;d ever get to do in America as a second-year medical student .\n",
      "The student volunteers usually pay their own way to Cameroon , often arriving with donated medical supplies .\n",
      "But once they arrive in Yaounde , their board , transportation and instruction are covered by Bwelle .\n",
      "&quot; He &apos;s a hero , without a doubt , &quot; O &apos;Malley said .\n",
      "He gives his life to this organization , and his desire to help the Cameroon people is everlasting .\n",
      "For Bwelle , the near-constant workload isn &apos;t a hardship .\n",
      "Helping others live happier lives , fulfilling a promise he made to his father , is something that brings him great joy .\n",
      "&quot; I am so happy when I am doing this work , &quot; Bwelle said .\n",
      "And I think about my father .\n",

      "There &apos;s no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame\n",
      "Experts think the obesity epidemic might be one trigger of early puberty\n",
      "The trend toward early puberty is not as pronounced with boys\n",
      "Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children &apos;s health and family issues .\n",
      "Should a mother be alarmed if her daughter begins to sprout breast buds and pubic hair at 7 or 8 ?\n",
      "At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando , Florida , pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new norm .\n",
      "&quot; I spend a lot of time reassuring parents -- usually , this does not signal a rapid progression into full puberty , &quot; said Kaplowitz .\n",
      "Obvious signs of development , such as budding breasts , pubic and underarm hair and body odor are appearing sooner in girls .\n",
      "But there has been only a slight shift in the age of menarche (the first period) over the past four decades .\n",
      "In the United States , the average age is 12.5 years , down from 12.75 in 1970 .\n",
      "&quot; Once breasts begin to develop , it takes at least two to three years before menarche , &quot; said Kaplowitz , also author of &quot; Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem . &quot;\n",
      "Time is the most accurate test of how puberty is going to progress .\n",
      "There is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty , but it is considered &quot; precocious &quot; when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before age 8 .\n",
      "In most cases , the process will slow down or stall -- something a pediatrician can monitor closely .\n",
      "A more rapid progression may warrant tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts .\n",
      "There are treatments to delay early menses and ward off another consequence: premature aging of the bones that ultimately can lead to stunted growth and being short as an adult .\n",
      "Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy are based on the child &apos;s age , rate of development , growth rate and emotional maturity .\n",
      "Psychosocial aspects are important , too .\n",
      "Kaplowitz is cautious with medication but acknowledges , &quot; suppressing puberty may alleviate behavioral issues and girls &apos; feelings of being different from peers . &quot;\n",
      "The other big issue is understandable: Parents simply don &apos;t want their very young daughters having periods .\n",
      "&quot; They worry about the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene , &quot; said Kaplowitz .\n",
      "&quot; It was a shock , &quot; recalls one woman whose daughter started her period at 10 .\n",
      "Even though there were signs and we had talked about menstruation , she was not emotionally prepared .\n",
      "She came home from school scared and upset to be the first among her friends .\n",
      "There are lots of well-publicized theories about the causes of precocious puberty .\n",
      "Yet , there &apos;s no consistent body of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are to blame .\n",
      "Boys - like girls - are hitting puberty earlier .\n",
      "Kaplowitz contends the premise that holds the most weight is the epidemic of obesity .\n",
      "He helped conduct a 2001 study of 6- to 9-year-old girls that links body fat to the timing of puberty .\n",
      "Other findings support this conclusion , but there are many other contributing factors .\n",
      "In this country , African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts .\n",
      "There are varying explanations .\n",
      "Globally , patterns of early puberty appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes .\n",
      "Another conundrum: Although boys are getting facial and pubic hair at younger ages , the trend toward full-blown early puberty is not as pronounced as it is with girls .\n",
      "Other doctors attending the AAP conference reinforced the complexities of the topic .\n",
      "The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in infants and toddlers .\n",
      "&quot; We need to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty , &quot; said Dr. Lawrence Silverman , a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children &apos;s Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey .\n",
      "Parents should not hesitate to get guidance from their pediatrician about how to talk with their child .\n",

      "The solicitor , who was nicknamed &quot; Bash &quot; and hailed by criminals as a &quot; top brief , &quot; was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police surveillance operation into Scarborough , who he had represented in a previous narcotics trial .\n",
      "Officers spotted Sarborough , 32 , dropping off three bags of cocaine at the lawyer &apos;s home in Blackburn , Lancashire , while he was out at a Law Society dinner with colleagues .\n",

      "The lawyer &apos;s downfall came after police investigating Scarborough discovered he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011 .\n",
      "Two detectives trailed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta &apos;s house in and was seen to place the drugs which had a purity of 60 per cent under the lawyer &apos;s bins in a black golf glove .\n",
      "Soon after the drop off , Scarborough was in regular phone contact with Ditta who had been out at the dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium , Ewood Park .\n",

      "The court heard Ditta was a &quot; regular user &quot; of cocaine after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his hair , wallet and on his credit cards\n",
      "Ditta was arrested later but denied using cocaine and and said he had been speaking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and argued their discussions were subject to &quot; legal privilege . &quot;\n",
      "During his arrest Ditta picked up his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken fom him .\n",
      "In a police interview he said he ran an office at his home address as well as work place and clients would call at his house on legal business .\n",

      "The relationship we are talking about is not simply a drug dealer , but a drug dealer providing his own lawyer with drugs .\n",
      "Some of his communications will undoubtedly have been legitimate ones because he was their lawyer .\n",

      "The new carry-on fee is for bags in the overhead bin , so small bags under the seat will still be free .\n",
      "Frontier said it will charge $ 25 if the fee is paid in advance , $ 100 if travelers wait to pay until they &apos;re at the gate .\n",
      "Frontier spokeswoman Kate O &apos;Malley said the $ 100 fee is to get travelers to take care of the charge in advance .\n",
      "&quot; We don &apos;t want to charge that , &quot; she said .\n",
      "Airlines began charging for the first and second checked bags in 2008 .\n",
      "Passengers trying to avoid those fees have been stuffing as much as they can into carry-on baggage stashed in overhead bins , meaning those bins often run out of space .\n",
      "Fees are one way to get passengers to bring less on board .\n",

      "Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline &apos;s website won &apos;t have to pay .\n",

      "Passengers often grumble about baggage charges and other fees , but airlines love them .\n",
      "They argue that luggage costs money to handle , and passengers who want the service should pay for it .\n",
      "Many on Wall Street view the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses .\n",
      "Most haven &apos;t touched carry-on bag fees , though .\n",
      "Spirit Airlines Inc. started the first carry-on fee three years ago , and fellow discounter Allegiant Air later followed .\n",
      "The only other airline with such a fee is Hungary &apos;s Wizz Air , said airline consultant Jay Sorensen , who closely tracks add-on fees .\n",
      "He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit &apos;s carry-on fee brings in $ 50 million a year .\n",
      "Sorensen , a former executive with Midwest Airlines , flew Spirit recently and wondered what he &apos;d find at the gate as passengers encountered Spirit &apos;s unusual carry-on bag fee .\n",
      "&quot; The boarding process was the smoothest I had seen in my airline career , &quot; he said .\n",
      "I was expecting to see gnashing of teeth and a fight breaking out at the gate .\n",
      "The plane was full , he said , &quot; and it boarded lickety-split . &quot;\n",
      "Frontier is also following Spirit &apos;s $ 2 charge for coffee , tea , soda , or juice .\n",
      "Frontier said passengers who get soda or juice can keep the whole can , and it will give coffee refills for free .\n",
      "It will still give away water .\n",
      "US Airways briefly tried charging for beverages in 2008 but backed down seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline followed .\n",
      "Frontier &apos;s move to charge the carry-on fee if passengers don &apos;t buy direct from the airline is its latest effort to steer customers toward its own website .\n",
      "Airlines pay online travel sellers such as Orbitz $ 10 to $ 25 for each ticket sold .\n",
      "That has given all airlines an incentive to steer passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency .\n",
      "Frontier has gone the furthest in this area , though .\n",
      "In September it began giving half as many frequent flier miles to customers who bought through an online travel agency .\n",
      "On Wednesday it slashed the mileage award to 25 percent of the miles of the trip .\n",
      "So , a 1,000 mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles .\n",
      "It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy directly from the Frontier website .\n",
      "Frontier has a loyal base of customers in its home city of Denver , but its business is shrinking and losing money .\n",
      "Revenue dropped 9 percent and its flying capacity shrank almost 13 percent in the first quarter , according to financial results released Wednesday by corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc .\n",
      "Republic has been trying to fix Frontier &apos;s finances as part of selling the airline .\n",
      "US borders: &quot; Super tunnel &quot; for drug smuggling discovered\n",
      "On the border between Mexico and the USA , investigators have discovered and shut down a &quot; super tunnel &quot; intended for drug smuggling .\n",
      "As announced by the US Customs Authorities , the pipe between Tijuana and San Diego , measuring more than 500 metres in length , was equipped with electricity , a railway track and a ventilation system .\n",
      "Three suspects were detained in relation to the discovery , with eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine seized .\n",
      "According to the details provided , the tunnel had not yet been put into use .\n",
      "&quot; These cartels are stupid if they think that they can dig through under the radar , &quot; said the US Attorney for the District of Southern California , Laura Diffy , at a press conference held in front of a warehouse in San Diego , where the end of the tunnel was discovered .\n",
      "Referring to the drug gangs , Duffy assured: &quot; If you continue to build and attempt to use these tunnels , we are determined to make this a big waste of your dirty money &quot; .\n",
      "Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are engaged in an ongoing battle against the drug cartels .\n",
      "Since 2006 , more than 77,000 people have been killed in conjunction with drug crime in Mexico .\n",
      "Built by experts\n",
      "Due to the elaborate configuration of the tunnel , investigators are working on the assumption that it was build by architects and engineers and that the construction took around one year .\n",
      "The railway system was equipped in such a way that electrically powered carts could be used on it .\n",
      "On the Mexican side , the entrance is located in a building located 80 metres from the border .\n",
      "According to the authorities , a ladder runs 20 metres underground to the actual entrance of the tunnel .\n",
      "The tunnel has a cross-section measuring 1.20 metres high and 90 centimetres across .\n",
      "It would thus be suitable to assist illegal immigration into the USA .\n",
      "Two of the suspects were detained in conjunction with the cocaine find .\n",
      "The third , a Mexican , was detained due to the seizure of the marijuana .\n",
      "All three face a maximum penalty of life imprisonment , according to the authorities .\n",
      "Since 2006 , eight tunnels of this type have been discovered , the press conference in San Diego continued .\n",
      "However , this was the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel construction .\n",
      "Normally cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels .\n",
      "This shows the &quot; desperation &quot; of the drug gangs , whose traditional routes have now been cut off , said Bill Sherman of the DEA Drug Squad in San Diego .\n",
      "They will do anything to make it to the USA .\n",
      "No specific details were given regarding those detained , but it is reported that at least one is Mexican\n",
      "They can expect prison terms of up to ten years .\n",

      "Drew Bowler , the managing director of Bowler Motorsport , said: &quot; Rally customers coming to Bowler have changed . &quot;\n",
      "They &apos;re not all experienced racers , but people looking for excitement and adventure , and an achievable path towards world-class events .\n",
      "We &apos;re delighted to be offering this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA , and believe the format offers a new way to experience different rally disciplines in the UK and overseas , and prepare entrants for the rigours and realities of Rally Raid .\n",
      "We &apos;ve really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car - it &apos;ll be a really fun championship .\n",

      "Ben Greenman: The Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker\n",
      "One could argue that New York City is the birthplace of standup comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago , the vaudevillian Frank Fay , who served as the master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre , on Broadway , started telling jokes directly to the crowd , in a conversational manner .\n",
      "Fay &apos;s innovation has been extended through the years , most recently by the New York Comedy Festival .\n",
      "Created and overseen by Caroline Hirsch , the founder of the standup institution Carolines , the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year , with more than sixty shows at small clubs and large theatres .\n",
      "&quot; Most of these headliners appeared at Carolines , and went on to greater success , to the point where they &apos;re too big to play a club , &quot; Hirsch said .\n",
      "We built this festival as a way of continuing to work with them .\n",
      "This year &apos;s event includes appearances by Wanda Sykes , Kathy Griffin , and Bill Maher , as well as &quot; Stand Up for Heroes , &quot; an annual music-and-comedy benefit for military veterans , at Madison Square Garden , featuring , among others , Bruce Springsteen , Jon Stewart , Roger Waters , and Bill Cosby .\n",
      "As the festival has expanded , so has the world of comedy .\n",
      "Several of the comedians participating in this year &apos;s festival came up through nontraditional channels , such as shows on smaller networks , like Comedy Central , FX , and Spike .\n",
      "Nick Kroll rose to prominence on a deep-cable sitcom (FXX &apos;s gleefully raunchy fantasy-football-themed &quot; The League &quot;) and now has his own Comedy Central sketch show .\n",
      "Jenny Slate has been a cast member on both &quot; Saturday Night Live &quot; and &quot; Parks and Recreation , &quot; though she is best known for her viral video series &quot; Marcel the Shell with Shoes On . &quot;\n",
      "Both Kroll and Slate , as well as other young comedians with distinctive voices (the surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik , the wry , racially focussed W. Kamau Bell), are products of the decentralized world of American comedy .\n",
      "One of the festival &apos;s biggest draws will be an interview: David Steinberg talking to Larry David .\n",
      "Steinberg started as a standup comedian but has become an accomplished television and film director , as well as an unofficial comedy historian .\n",
      "From 2005 to 2007 , he hosted a show on TV Land called &quot; Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg . &quot;\n",
      "The meeting takes place at Town Hall , in the center of Manhattan .\n",
      "&quot; The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all of Larry &apos;s work , &quot; Steinberg said .\n",

      "A 21-year-old Sydney woman sentenced to 15 days jail in Phuket for falsely claiming she was assaulted by a taxi driver is appealing the verdict and has been granted bail .\n",
      "Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a Phuket provincial court on June 15 of making false claims after telling Thai police a local taxi driver , with two other men restraining her , carried out the assault in the early hours of Sunday June 10 .\n",
      "However , CCTV footage later revealed she had returned to her hotel safely after becoming separated from her Australian boyfriend .\n",
      "Phuket police interviewed Bamford for two days before she confessed to fabricating the story .\n",
      "She was held in local police cells before the court hearing .\n",
      "Bamford was sentenced to serve the 15-day prison term at a low security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket rather than in an adult women &apos;s jail .\n",
      "She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks , who has appealed to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra to assist his daughter .\n",
      "Tunks told Sydney &apos;s Sunday Telegraph the whole family was &quot; extremely concerned &quot; about his daughter &apos;s welfare and wanted her back in Australia .\n",
      "&quot; It &apos;s obviously been a worrying time but we &apos;re hopeful to have her back home safely as soon as possible , &quot; Tunks said .\n",
      "Bamford is appealing the sentence and has been granted bail of 50,000 baht .\n",
      "Reports in Australia said that in the meantime , she was holidaying at the resort area of Krabi in Southern Thailand .\n",
      "Thai-based legal sources said Bamford was being represented by a local lawyer in Phuket but warned that the appeal may lead to the court increasing her sentence by up to two years and forcing her to serve it in an adult prison .\n",
      "However , following the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket , Thailand may also be looking to repair its battered tourist image , leading to an acquittal .\n",
      "Bombardier profit dips as plane deliveries , orders fall\n",
      "Canadian plane and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent fall in net profit on Thursday , pressured by fewer aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract issues in its train unit .\n",
      "Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release any flight test data for its brand-new CSeries aircraft or offer an update on whether the plane will meet its ambitious schedule of going into commercial service by next September .\n",
      "After the test plane &apos;s inaugural flight about a month and a half ago , it has only flown three more times , raising questions over whether the testing phase is on track .\n",
      "Results fell short of forecasts and sent shares sliding more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange .\n",
      "Cameron Doerksen , an analyst with National Bank Financial , lowered his rating to &quot; sector perform &quot; from &quot; outperform &quot; on Thursday with the view that the stock has limited upside over the next one or two quarters .\n",
      "&quot; While the weaker aircraft deliveries were mostly anticipated , we are clearly disappointed by the margin performance in transportation , &quot; Doerksen said in a client note .\n",
      "We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the flight test program progresses .\n",
      "However , if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we suspect that the market will become more skeptical of the program .\n",
      "Bombardier hopes the CSeries aircraft family can catapult it into the low end of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus .\n",
      "The first test plane was unveiled in March and took flight for the first time in September after months of delays .\n",
      "But firm orders for the CSeries are moderate so far at 177 as potential buyers wait for flight test results to validate the company &apos;s claims about the new jetliner &apos;s fuel efficiency and cost savings potential .\n",
      "There are currently 403 total orders and commitments with 15 customers and operators .\n",
      "Chief Executive Officer Pierre Beaudoin was confident Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target by the time the first jet is put into commercial use .\n",
      "Executives also reassured analysts and media on Thursday the program was progressing according to schedule .\n",
      "&quot; The test plane didn &apos;t stay on the ground longer than anticipated , &quot; Beaudoin said in a conference call , adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the plane &apos;s downtime .\n",
      "Every manufacturer schedules it in a different way .\n",
      "We had decided to do a first flight and to do an update period and that &apos;s what we have done .\n",
      "That will happen all through the flight program .\n",
      "The second of five test planes is expected to take flight in the coming weeks , with the remainder following shortly after , the company said .\n",
      "Still , analysts are skeptical the first customer can begin operating a CSeries plane 12 months after its maiden flight .\n",
      "Bombardier said it was evaluating the entry-into-service (EIS) schedule and will provide an update in the next few months .\n",
      "&quot; This slow pace of flight testing - although in line with Bombardier &apos;s internal schedule apparently - reinforces our view that entry-into-service will be pushed to Q1 / 15 , &quot; said Doerksen .\n",
      "For the third quarter ended September 30 , Bombardier &apos;s net profit fell to $ 147 million , or 8 cents per share , from $ 172 million , or 9 cents per share a year earlier .\n",
      "Adjusted earnings per share were unchanged at 9 cents .\n",

      "Net orders fell to 26 aircraft , from 83 .\n",
      "The backlog in the aerospace division was $ 32.9 billion as of September 30 , unchanged from December 31 .\n",
      "&quot; In aerospace , results were in line with our guidance , but the low order intake and overall market conditions were a disappointment , &quot; Beaudoin said .\n",
      "Aerospace revenue fell 13 percent to $ 2 billion .\n",
      "Bombardier , the world &apos;s largest trainmaker , said revenue in that division rose nearly 11 percent to $ 2.1 billion .\n",
      "The order backlog in the transportation unit was $ 32.6 billion as of September 30 , up marginally from December 31 .\n",
      "The transportation division &apos;s margins were affected by execution issues in a few large contracts .\n",
      "Executives said new guidance would be provided in the fourth quarter .\n",
      "Shares of Bombardier , which also announced that Google Inc Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette would join the board , were down 8.5 percent at C $ 4.83 in mid afternoon trading on Thursday .\n",

      "Kenyan press outraged at controversial media law\n",
      "&quot; It is a frightening place , and it is valid to ask: what is there to prevent Parliament from simply sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow ? &quot; the paper said , challenging the bill as unconstitutional .\n",
      "&quot; This law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it , &quot; said Cyrus Kamau , managing director for Capital Group - home to CapitalFM , one of Kenya &apos;s most respected independent radio stations and news websites .\n",
      "He said the new media tribunal &quot; will always be biased because it &apos;s an extension of the government , &quot; and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya &apos;s place in the global economy .\n",
      "&quot; I hope the president will listen to us , and we appeal to him to reject this bill and return it to the MPs , &quot; he said .\n",
      "According to The Star newspaper , the new bill will effectively hand the government &quot; a stranglehold over the media , &quot; while The Standard said democracy and free speech in Kenya had been &quot; dealt a major blow &quot; and lambasted the bill as &quot; draconian . &quot;\n",
      "The passing of the bill comes amid a string of measures to reinforce national security in the wake of the September &apos;s attack by Islamist gunmen on the Westgate shopping mall .\n",
      "Kenya media drew the ire of authorities by broadcasting security camera footage of troops who were dispatched to the scene of the attack purportedly robbing the upmarket mall .\n",
      "Police chief David Kimaiyo reacted by summoning two journalists and a media executive for questioning , although the summons was retracted following a media outcry .\n",
      "Under the new bill , media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million with the additional risk of being &quot; de-listed , &quot; or barred from receiving official press accreditation .\n",
      "The tribunal also has the power to seize the property of an offender if a fine is not paid .\n",
      "According to the Daily Nation , &quot; even one fine is enough to cripple most FM stations . &quot;\n",
      "It also said the measures could have a devastating effect on what it described as Kenya &apos;s &quot; lively blogosphere . &quot;\n",
      "By silencing the media , politicians know they can do whatever they like with impunity .\n",
      "&quot; No one will ever know , &quot; wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Mathiu , describing the Kenyan media as a key source of checks and balances in public life .\n",

      "Tax on foreign property owners to burst London &apos;s bubble\n",
      "The Treasury have provisionally costed out the CGT measure but are awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne , who , in the 2012 Budget , introduced a 7% rate of stamp duty for homes costing more than £ 2m and annual charges for buyers who choose to hold homes in a company rather than as individuals .\n",
      "Already the stamp duty take for residential property in the boroughs of Westminster and Kensington &amp; Chelsea , which stood at £ 708 million in the 2012 / 13 tax year , exceeds the combined total for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , the North East , North West and Yorkshire and the Humber put together .\n",
      "Mr Cook said: &quot; Following increases in stamp duty of high value homes and the introduction of associated anti-avoidance legislation , it is very difficult to argue that high value property is under-taxed irrespective of the effect of the out-dated council tax system . &quot;\n",
      "&quot; But this move could make some foreign investors reticent to buy property in London or current owners reluctant to sell , &quot; he added .\n",
      "Prime property - the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price - in the affluent south-west London belt , which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon , has increased by a record 11.8% over the past year .\n",

      "Business for Britain launched in April with a pledge to bring business together and define what the UK &apos;s wealth and job creators want to see changed in our relationship with the EU .\n",
      "To that end , we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive poll of British business leaders asking them for their thoughts on Britain , business and the EU .\n",
      "YouGov polled over 1,000 business leaders , broadly representative of Britain &apos;s business sizes , sectors and regions .\n",
      "The conclusions of the poll will come as a surprise to many .\n",
      "We found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking to export outside of Europe , focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while the EU states stagnate .\n",
      "They want to see the Government prioritise new trading links with the likes of China , India and Brazil , rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming the EU &apos;s arcane institutions .\n",
      "When asked their views on specific policy areas - ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws - the majority of business leaders thought that control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster .\n",
      "There was general discontent with the Single Market , with businesses saying that the costs of Brussels regulation now outweighed the benefits of being part of Europe &apos;s trading area - even 40 per cent of large businesses , traditionally the most pro-European of companies , agreed .\n",
      "Finally , and most tellingly of all , our poll of business leaders found a clear majority wanted to see Britain pursue a course of treaty change and a relationship with the EU that is based on trade , not politics .\n",
      "This finding , which was reflected across the sizes and major business groups , shows that business is pushing for a &quot; meaningful change &quot; that brings powers back to the UK .\n",
      "The stakes are high - achieving treaty change and a better deal for Britain sees a 16 per cent swing towards voting to stay in the EU in a referendum .\n",
      "The Prime Minister should be in no doubt: this poll shows that British business backs his plan for renegotiating the terms of Britain &apos;s membership of the EU .\n",
      "It also shows that business expects that renegotiation to make a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK .\n",
      "A better deal for British business is possible , and increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on the road to closer economic and fiscal union .\n",
      "The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and , as the findings of our poll show , for business this means a renewed focus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels &quot; regulatory approach .\n",

      "The mining magnate , who is in a dispute about paying a $ 6 million carbon tax bill , made the claim as he tried to brush off questions about whether he had a conflict .\n",
      "The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate that may be crucial in deciding if the carbon and mining taxes are axed .\n",
      "But Mr Palmer claimed it was only ministers who could have a conflict of interest and said Mr Abbott &apos;s daughters stood to personally benefit from policies .\n",

      "Gutach: Increased safety for pedestrians\n",
      "They are not even 100 metres apart: On Tuesday , the new B 33 pedestrian lights in Dorfparkplatz in Gutach became operational - within view of the existing Town Hall traffic lights .\n",
      "Two sets of lights so close to one another: intentional or just a silly error ?\n",
      "Yesterday , Gutacht &apos;s Mayor gave a clear answer to this question .\n",
      "&quot; At the time , the Town Hall traffic lights were installed because this was a school route , &quot; explained Eckert yesterday .\n",
      "The Kluser lights protect cyclists , as well as those travelling by bus and the residents of Bergle .\n",
      "The system , which officially became operational yesterday , is of importance to the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstrasse junction .\n",
      "We have the museum , two churches , the spa gardens , the bus stop , a doctor &apos;s practice and a bank , not to mention the traffic from the &apos; Grub &apos; residential area .\n",
      "&quot; At times of high road and pedestrian traffic , an additional set of lights were required to ensure safety , &quot; said Eckert .\n",
      "This was also confirmed by Peter Arnold from the Offenburg District Office .\n",
      "&quot; According to current measurements , around 12,000 vehicles travel through the town of Gutach on the B33 on a daily basis , of which heavy goods traffic accounts for around ten per cent , &quot; emphasised Arnold .\n",
      "Therefore the construction of an additional set of lights was more than necessary: &quot; Here safety comes first , it &apos;s that simple , &quot; said Arnold .\n",
      "A total of four road safety inspections were carried out and a roundabout was also considered , however , this idea was rejected on account of the narrowness of the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstrasse junctions .\n",
      "According to Arnold , every possible test was carried out prior to the selection of the location for the traffic light posts: &quot; Using a goods vehicle loaded with particularly long tree trunks , we also tested whether such vehicles could access the B 33 from the Sulzbachweg without knocking over the traffic light posts &quot; .\n",
      "The traffic light system itself , which cost around EUR 15,000 , is the &quot; most modern system that is currently available on the market , &quot; explained Arnold .\n",
      "The system is fitted with coloured LEDs , which are bright enough that drivers can easily see the lights , even when the sun is low in the sky .\n",
      "And they are also energy-efficient: The older light systems consume around 100 Watts , with the new ones consuming just eight .\n",
      "There are three sets of lights per direction of travel .\n",
      "Arnold explained the technology used by the new system: It is fitted with two radar sensors .\n",
      "If the pedestrian presses the button at the traffic lights , the top radar sensor checks the traffic status .\n",
      "If the street is clear , the pedestrian obtains a green light immediately , if not , there is a delay of around 15 seconds .\n",
      "An additional radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be ended .\n",
      "&quot; If a group of people or if disabled persons are crossing the street , the green phase is extended , thus ensuring that everyone gets safely across the street , &quot; explained Arnold .\n",
      "Of course , drivers must also play their part and keep their eyes on the road .\n",
      "Yesterday this was not the case: The light had barely turned green for pedestrians when a luxury vehicle sped through on a red light .\n",

      "A British entrepreneur has created the world &apos;s first glow-in-the-dark ice cream - using jellyfish .\n",
      "Charlie Francis has harnessed the fluorescent properties of the marine animal to develop the luminescent snack .\n",
      "He came up with the idea after reading a research paper on jellyfish and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate the glowing protein .\n",
      "The ice cream reacts with the eater &apos;s tongue - raising the pH level in the protein and making it glow .\n",
      "Chris says because the ice cream lights up when it reacts with the heat of the mouth it means the more you lick , the brighter it becomes .\n",
      "Charlie , founder of the &quot; Lick Me I &apos;m Delicious &quot; ice cream company , said: &quot; It is incredible stuff but still at very early days in terms of production , so £ 200 gets you about 2g of the stuff . &quot;\n",
      "The protein we are using in the ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH .\n",
      "So as your mouth warms up the protein it will raise the pH level and the ice cream will glow .\n",
      "We have been testing it out over the past few months and it seemed perfect to share it over Halloween because it gives that wonderful glow effect .\n",
      "It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have made because the jellyfish luminescence is four times more expensive than gold .\n",
      "So each scoop costs me around £ 140 .\n",
      "It tastes pretty good though .\n",
      "Charlie &apos;s experimental company , based in Bristol , is famed for its unusual flavours including beer , cheese , beef and gold leaf .\n",
      "But his next creation is set to be even more ambitious .\n",
      "He said: &quot; I really want to develop an invisible ice cream . &quot;\n",
      "It is inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals which make up the ice cream , but I reckon we will find a way of doing it .\n",
      "The ice cream harnesses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish , synthesized by Chinese scientists\n",

      "With a slender squad , the TSV Freudenstadt Herren I team (Men &apos;s First Team) stepped into the Schiller School Gymnasium in Reutlingen to face TG Gönningen of the Swabian Alb region .\n",
      "The Alb men stood on the other side of the net with what was undoubtedly a more experienced team .\n",
      "However , it soon became evident that , due in part to their age , they could not really keep up with the fast pace of the Freudenstadt team .\n",
      "Gönningen found it extremely difficult to cope with the hard and well-positioned offensive moves .\n",
      "They repeatedly missed the passes and attacks coming cleanly over the net from Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz and their blocking game was not up to scratch .\n",
      "Clear victories in the first two sets clearly demonstrated the superiority of the Freudenstadt team in all areas .\n",
      "Faced with this overwhelming and match-determining performance , the third set was won following a somewhat tame and spiritless performance , for a final score of 3: 0 (25: 13 , 25: 14 , 25: 22).\n",
      "On 2 November , when they play TV Baiersbronn , who managed a clear victory in Nagold , they will step onto the court to face a much stronger opponent .\n",

      "In the B Class , two teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced off in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn .\n",
      "They produced a hard-fought two-hour match .\n",
      "Nerves on both sides , particularly when receiving the ball , resulted in errors and lost points; there was even a lack of passing at times and at some critical moments overeagerness saw potential points wasted .\n",
      "However , in this evenly matched game , the great physical effort of Marcus Blasutto &apos;s TSV team proved decisive in spite of tremendous commitment by both teams .\n",

      "&quot; The prosecution suggests that Mr Coulson , who is now the editor of the NotW , he is not the man who stands outside people &apos;s houses hoping to catch them out , he is the man who likes to put the story to people to see what they will say , &quot; Mr Edis said .\n",
      "He said the NotW used three ways to investigate stories: phone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation .\n",

      "He says he doesn &apos;t , we say &quot; Oh yes , he did &quot; .\n",

      "A tape of voicemails taken from her phone on at least three occasions was seized from Mulcaire &apos;s home in August 2006 .\n",
      "Investigators also found entries on the private investigator &apos;s computer which had Ms Pawlby and her sister as &quot; Projects . &quot;\n",
      "During the period she was being investigated , Ms Pawlby &apos;s grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her , Mr Edis said .\n",
      "Meanwhile , former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw surveillance of Ms Pawlby &apos;s movements .\n",
      "Leaving her a voicemail on June 18 2005 , Coulson told her: &quot; I &apos;ve got a story that we &apos;re planning to run tomorrow that I really would like to speak to Charles about . &quot;\n",
      "Mr Edis said Coulson &apos;s involvement in the story followed the same pattern as with other important men , such as former home secretary David Blunkett .\n",

      "&quot; We will not participate in the wild card process , &quot; said former national team player Pascal Roller , who has been putting together the concept for a professional club in the Hansa town since 2012 .\n",
      "However , there was no sigh of relief to be heard from Ludwigsburg .\n",
      "&quot; We are not concerning ourselves with the wild card process until it is certain that Düsseldorf is not receiving a licence , &quot; said boss of the Neckar Riesen Alexander Reil , speaking to our paper .\n",
      "Newly promoted Düsseldorf Baskets have until 23 May to submit documents to the arbitration panel and prove their financial fitness for the Bundesliga .\n",
      "However , the Rhineland team have already been refused the licence twice .\n",
      "The Court of Arbitration is the authority of last resort .\n",
      "Networking between universities and companies is important\n",
      "On a visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald , it was explained to Parliamentary President Guido Wolf in Titisee-Neustadt where the workforce of tomorrow will come from .\n",
      "In the Hochschwarzwald Support Centre , he addressed this important question alongside the executive principals of the vocational colleges and the district grammar school and the chairs of the parents &apos; council .\n",
      "&quot; Education is an important factor for the location , &quot; highlighted Claudia Stehle , Director of the Hans Thoma School , which introduced the networked Hochschwarzwald Education Centre Schools Project .\n",
      "During the presentation , Wolf seemed impressed by the educational pilot project .\n",
      "Since 2011 , there has been successful collaboration in Wälderstadt between the Support Centre , the District Grammar School and the Vocational School Complex .\n",
      "He also praised the family-friendly approach within the district .\n",
      "&quot; It is important , not only to keep the family life stage in mind , but , on account of demographic change , the period spent providing long-term care and support for relatives as well , &quot; explained Wolf .\n",
      "He also stated that an increasing number of employed persons are looking after the long-term care and support of relatives .\n",
      "&quot; Without support from their employer , the resulting burden placed on employees could result in the termination of the employment contract , &quot; said Wolf .\n",
      "However , nobody can afford to lose qualified workers , &quot; he added .\n",
      "Another , particularly important factor is that of networking between universities and companies .\n",
      "&quot; After all , people who have learned of the merits of the region during their studies often remain within the region , along with their acquired knowledge and skills , which contributes to the strengthening of the region , &quot; said the State Parliamentary President , expressing his thorough conviction .\n",
      "For it is only if a sufficient number of educational places can be provided that the need for skilled workers can be covered .\n",
      "In his opinion , the district &apos;s advantage as a location is its advantageous location in south-west Germany , in immediate proximity to France and Switzerland .\n",
      "In addition to this , on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg , he experienced first-hand the efforts already undertaken to develop public transport .\n",
      "&quot; You must continue to be tenacious and make sure that local public transport becomes even better , &quot; he explained in the address given to the local politicians in attendance .\n",

      "This was announced by Ulrich Knobel of the organising Illmensee Sports Club .\n",
      "Among the participants there were also numerous amateur cyclists who wanted the chance to practice their hobby in a competitive environment , in particular over the short distance of 15 kilometres with a 300 metre climb .\n",
      "Two top-class junior cyclists were also in the starting line-up for the competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation of having achieved good positions at the German Championships .\n",
      "The pair managed to break away from the field in keeping with expectations .\n",
      "As was the case the previous year , Felix Bader managed to hold on to a small lead right to the end and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance race\n",

      "Participants &apos; ages were also wide-ranging , with the youngest starters at ten years old up to the oldest at over 70 .\n",

      "Hermann and Warthmann then reached the finish line simultaneously to take joint third in the overall standings .\n",
      "In the ladies &apos; race , Christiane Cohsmann achieved the fastest time in the main race .\n",

      "Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders in its foreign exchange division according to two people familiar with the situation , in another sign that the global probe by regulators into the suspected manipulation of the currency market is rapidly gaining traction .\n",
      "Some of the world &apos;s largest banks , including UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank and RBS , have confirmed they are co-operating with regulators in investigations into the world &apos;s largest financial market , where $ 5.3tn changes hands each day .\n",
      "The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the widening probe that echoes the Libor interbank lending manipulation scandal .\n",
      "The bank , which declined to comment on the suspensions , confirmed this month that it has received requests for information from regulators .\n",
      "&quot; Our ongoing inquiry into this matter continues and we are co-operating fully with the FCA and our other regulators , &quot; the bank said two weeks ago .\n",
      "Last month , people close to the situation said that RBS had turned over records of emails and instant messages to the UK regulator , the Financial Conduct Authority , sent to and from a former trader .\n",
      "This trader , Richard Usher , left RBS in 2010 and is understand to have be given leave from his current position as European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan .\n",
      "Rohan Ramchandani , head of European spot trading at Citi , went on leave this week , while Matt Gardiner , a former senior currencies trader at Barclays and UBS , was suspended by Standard Chartered this week .\n",
      "None of these traders have been accused of any wrongdoing .\n",
      "Mr Usher &apos;s instant message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup , people close to the situation said .\n",
      "UBS said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator , Finma , said it was investigating suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks .\n",
      "At least six authorities globally - the European Commission , Finma , Switzerland &apos;s competition authority Weko , the FCA , the Department of Justice in the US and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are looking at allegations that bankers colluded to move the currencies market .\n",
      "HSBC , Citigroup , JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal probes or received requests for information from regulators , said people familiar with the situation .\n",
      "Banks are scouring through years &quot; worth of instant messages and emails to search for instances of wrongdoing .\n",
      "News about the probes has rattled traders in an area that has been one of the bigger profit drivers of investment banks &apos; trading units in past years but which has been challenged this year as low volatility in currencies cuts opportunities for speculators .\n",
      "Some bankers have tried to play down the affair by saying the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is almost impossible to manipulate , but senior traders are saying this is not necessarily true .\n",
      "A senior trader said that despite the huge volume of daily foreign exchange trading , the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks &quot; increasing use of their own internal platforms meant that &quot; you can start to get an impact on the market at quite small ticket prices . &quot;\n",
      "The news came on the same day as Credit Suisse announced it had dismissed a trader at its London exchange traded funds desk this week after he had caused a nearly $ 6m loss late last year .\n",
      "The bank promptly notified the relevant authorities and has been co-operating with its regulators .\n",
      "&quot; We are confident the trader acted alone and that the matter has been contained , &quot; Credit Suisse said .\n",
      "A study aiming to increase the benefits to Scotland of the HS2 rail project has been announced by the UK government .\n",
      "The work by HS2 Ltd suggests high-speed services to Scotland and the north of England will start as soon as Phase One opens in 2026 .\n",
      "Transport minister Baroness Kramer said the project would &quot; bring the UK together . &quot;\n",
      "Scottish transport minister Keith Brown said he was &quot; excited &quot; to work with the UK government on the plan .\n",
      "Phase One will consist of a new high speed rail line between London and the West Midlands .\n",
      "When Phase Two is completed , lines will run to Manchester and Leeds .\n",
      "In June the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and the North of England from £ 32.7bn to £ 42.6bn.\n",
      "The UK government , which has been holding talks with Transport Scotland , has instructed HS2 Ltd to look at further rail capacity and journey time improvements for northern England and Scotland .\n",
      "This is to include the possibility of eventual journey times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London of three hours or less .\n",
      "Baroness Kramer said: &quot; Our goal for HS2 is for a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together . &quot;\n",
      "We are driving forward HS2 because the benefits it will bring are huge .\n",
      "Without it we face a crisis in capacity on our rail network .\n",
      "But it is also about connectivity , across the UK 18 cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh will be better connected because of HS2 .\n",
      "Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael added: &quot; Today &apos;s announcement is good news for Scotland . &quot;\n",
      "For the Scottish government , Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to &quot; unequivocally &quot; back Scotland &apos;s inclusion in the HS2 network .\n",
      "Mr Brown said: &quot; High speed rail has the potential to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland , but also adds Scotland &apos;s economic weight to the overall case for high speed rail across Britain . &quot;\n",
      "So we are excited to work in partnership with the UK Government to examine options for bringing high speed rail to Scotland , creating benefit for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line which the Scottish Government is already planning .\n",
      "I look forward to reviewing the report of the investigation with UK ministers next year and together decide on the next steps .\n",
      "Pawnbrokers shine in Singapore as middle class feel the pinch\n",
      "At a pawnshop in Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore , Janani Amirthalinga is swapping a gold bangle , ring and pair of earrings to pay her daughters &quot; school fees .\n",
      "&quot; My husband and I have just bought a house so all my money &apos;s stuck there , &quot; Mrs Amirthalinga says .\n",
      "Even though she earns S $ 3,000 ($ 2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband works as well , the monthly family income is insufficient , she says .\n",
      "Indeed , such is demand across parts of southeast Asia - where household debt is rising - that ValueMax , where she is carrying out her transaction , this week became the third pawnshop to list on the Singapore stock exchange .\n",
      "Pawning jewellery is not merely a fast way to land cash - S $ 1,300 in Ms Amirthalinga &apos;s case - but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans .\n",
      "Typically pawnbrokers in Singapore charge an effective annual percentage rate of 17 per cent , just above the 15.4 per cent offered at United Overseas Bank , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre .\n",
      "However , pawnbrokers have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of salary , and can arrange loans faster than banks .\n",
      "Hence millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops as families feel the squeeze from rising living costs and ballooning household and consumer debt .\n",
      "After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis , and cheap credit fuelled by loose monetary policy in advanced economies , lower- and middle-income families are turning to pawn shops to make up the difference as their economies slow .\n",
      "This week Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s , the rating agency , cited increasing household leverage , mainly from rising mortgages , as a risk factor for Asian banks &quot; creditworthiness .\n",
      "It said that Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt to gross domestic product ratios in Asia .\n",
      "Malaysia topped the list at 80 per cent of GDP , up from 60 per cent in 2008 .\n",
      "Economists are also worried about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand , which this week narrowly emerged from technical recession .\n",
      "On Thursday , data showed continued export weakness , and a softening in consumer demand .\n",
      "&quot; Bottom line is that with costs rising , people in the middle to lower end &#91; of the income scale &#93; will be looking to supplement their income wherever they can , &quot; says Song Seng Wun , economist at CIMB , a Malaysian bank .\n",
      "Historically high prices for gold in the past two years have added to the rush to pawn personal belongings , as people take the opportunity to cash in the value of their family jewellery .\n",
      "In Singapore , about 70 per cent of items pawned at the city-state &apos;s 200 pawn outlets are gold .\n",
      "People are saying &quot; the gold price looks good , let &apos;s pawn grandma &apos;s gold chain and get it back next month .\n",
      "In Thailand the largest pawnshop operator , EasyMoney , has seen an up to 20 per cent rise in the number of customers using its outlets in recent months .\n",
      "Such is the growth in the pawn business that ValueMax , operator of the outlet at Bendemeer and of 15 others like it in Singapore , plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia - where it has four shops - but outside Asia too , says Yeah Lee Ching , ValueMax &apos;s executive director .\n",
      "The company will fund that by using 60 per cent of S $ 66m it raised this week in a listing on the Singapore stock exchange .\n",
      "While some discount lenders have come under fire for high interest rates , Ms Yeah says that not only does pawning offer cheaper rates than other lenders , it also does not add directly to debt .\n",
      "&quot; Customers are mortgaging items that they already own , and monetising personal assets does not increase household debt , &quot; she says .\n",
      "There &apos;s an increased social acceptance of pawnbroking as a means to secure short term , secured financing .\n",
      "Nor are the types of people who use pawnbrokers only the financially stretched .\n",
      "Wealthy people in Singapore also use ValueMax outlets , pawning gold bars or Rolex watches , which can command up to 60 per cent of their purchase price in cash .\n",
      "We see customers from all walks of life .\n",
      "&quot; They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow short term for business ventures or investments , or small businesses with a need to tide over their cash flow needs , &quot; says Ms Yeah .\n",
      "Sometimes they just need the money very quickly .\n",

      "Jumbo on the search for the &quot; world &apos;s best ham &quot;: For the TV programme &quot; Galileo &quot; , the Pro7 star visited Bonndorf .\n",
      "The presenter established one thing right from the outset: The most important thing when it comes to ham are the legs of pork - turbo fattening does not provide a good basis for this .\n",
      "Can ham bought in a supermarket be as good as a quality product ?\n",
      "Uli , boss of the large ham factory in Schwarzwald , explained to Jumbo how the Bonndorf company , &quot; Adler &quot; , operates .\n",
      "&quot; Germany &apos;s most-loved ham , &quot; said Jumbo , presenting the Black Forest ham .\n",
      "He could only enter the factory when wearing hair protection and a white coat .\n",
      "Jumbo also had to first disinfect his hands before he could reach for the microphone .\n",
      "Jumbo seen getting something to keep him going at a fast food restaurant in Waldshut\n",
      "&quot; Here they work with huge quantities , &quot; commented the television producers , astonished by the mass production of Black Forest ham .\n",
      "16,000 joints of meat per week speak for themselves .\n",
      "Weight , fat content and colour: Uli explained what was required for the best quality .\n",
      "The majority of the pigs are slaughtered at six months old .\n",
      "Television with standards ?\n",
      "Even specific details such as the pH value of the meat play a role .\n",
      "The darker the meat , the higher the pH value .\n",
      "&quot; I would be curious what would happen if you were to measure Roberto Blanco , &quot; said Jumbo cynically .\n",
      "Here the standard of private television production is presented in its purest form .\n",
      "Nonetheless , it is worth watching .\n",
      "The viewer sees that joints are still carved by hand .\n",
      "After all: Black Forest ham traditionally arrives on the shelf boneless .\n",
      "The secret of the ham is the mix of herbs combined with salt .\n",
      "The appearance of the smoking tower and furnace remind Jumbo of a submarine .\n",
      "The trick: Here fir branches in the smoker provide the special flavour of Black Forest ham .\n",
      "After 20 days in the smoke , the ham is finally almost black .\n",
      "&quot; And now the slice will disappear inside Jumbo , &quot; he said , announcing his sampling of the product .\n",
      "&quot; That is really delicious , &quot; said the TV star in conclusion .\n",

      "If truth be told , Waltraud Ries , lives a dreamy life .\n",
      "Her house is located in a peaceful neighbourhood in Stuttgart , with plenty of greenery , an old tree population , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .\n",
      "She is only a few minutes from the city centre using public transport .\n",
      "&quot; Hopefully you aren &apos;t afraid of spiders ? &quot; asks Waltraud Ries , pointing out a large spider on the door frame .\n",
      "I have been looking for a new home for my husband and myself for some time now .\n",
      "But you know how difficult that is in Stuttgart .\n",
      "However , the reason for the desire to move is not arachnophobia , but rather the fear of not being able to manage the large number of steps up to their house , and inside their home in their old age , she explained .\n",
      "Furthermore: Since undergoing a meniscus operation , the lady , in her mid-fifties , has had to experience for herself what it means to move from floor to floor with a disability .\n",
      "Only recently , she released a book on the subject of &quot; Living happily in old age - Which type of property is the best for me ? &quot; .\n",
      "&quot; Our home is the best example of a property that simply doesn &apos;t work in old age , &quot; she begins to recount .\n",
      "When she moved to the maisonette with her husband 20 years ago , it was simply just a pretty apartment in green surroundings .\n",
      "Now , in her mid-fifties , Waltraud Ries has different thoughts about it .\n",
      "However , she is aware that she is one of the few people to actually deal with the topic of &apos; living in old age &apos; .\n",
      "The majority of people put it to the back of their minds for as long as possible .\n",
      "Only other people get old , she says , smirking .\n",
      "Only when the psychological strain becomes severe do people give it consideration .\n",
      "&quot; But at this stage it can be too late , &quot; said Ries .\n",
      "In her book , the interior decorator presents 17 housing models for independent living in old age .\n",
      "&quot; However , which type of residence you choose is always a personal decision , &quot; she explains .\n",
      "There is no solution to overcoming old age .\n",
      "Even if you can afford to spend your retirement in Tuscany or Brittany , you should always take the fact that you may become ill into consideration .\n",
      "And: &apos; Without a sound knowledge of the local language , you can even become lonely when living the dolce vita , &apos; added the author , providing food for thought for those seeking to move abroad .\n",
      "Her models include classic care models , alternative living arrangements and the often-mentioned pensioners &apos; living community .\n",
      "In old age everyone has their quirks and ticks .\n",
      "&apos; However , this type of residential community would not be for me , &apos; she commented with a wink .\n",
      "Definitely nothing like student accommodation with a shared bathroom and kitchen .\n",
      "&apos; In old age you simply need your own space to withdraw to , &apos; said Ries .\n",
      "However , the author does not wish to rule out the possibility that a pensioners &apos; residential community can work .\n",
      "However , it must operate differently to the classic student digs .\n",
      "And sometimes you also just want your peace and quiet , &apos; she believes .\n",
      "With this opinion she is at least not alone in the State Capital .\n",
      "The experience of Theresa Rütten , head of the citizen &apos;s Life in Old Age service in the State Capital , is also that &apos; the majority of old people in Stuttgart want to remain in their own homes for as long as possible &apos; .\n",
      "Her agency agency advises people on the topic of &apos; growing old &apos; .\n",
      "Therefore the experience of the Stiftung Warentest consumer study is also that elderly people in particular would accept inconveniences and limitations just to be able to remain in their usual environment .\n",
      "Nowadays there are many possibilities for designing the house or apartment in such a way as to be barrier-free .\n",
      "Ries recommends that all those working on the age-appropriate renovation of their house or apartment first seek out in-depth information and don &apos;t simply use the first tradesman that comes along .\n",
      "Nowadays there are specialists in renovation to suit the needs of the elderly .\n",
      "Even in the case of rental apartments some landlords can have this work carried out , even if it is just a matter of raising the level of the toilet seat , clarified the interior designer .\n",
      "However , it is not always the case that your existing apartment can be made age-appropriate and therefore barrier-free , even if it is as beautiful as ever .\n",
      "Waltraud Ries had to go through this experience herself .\n",
      "You could of course install a stair lift inside the apartment , but the cobbled path up to the door of the apartment , featuring a number of steps would be a much greater hindrance .\n",
      "She will keep looking until she has found the ideal property for herself and her husband .\n",
      "She is more afraid of the move than of the spider on her front door .\n",

      "By doing away with these announcements - on average around 200 personal call-outs come through the loudspeakers per day - the atmosphere in the airport should be calmer in future .\n",
      "&quot; Experience has also shown that these individual announcements are relatively seldom taken notice of , and at the same time , all other information regarding changes to departure gates or flight times are somewhat lost among them , &quot; said Kleeman while chatting to the radio broadcaster .\n",

      "The Town Councils have decided that the answer is yes .\n",
      "Schiltach will have to contribute up to EUR 220,000 to the project .\n",
      "The Deutsche Bahn hopes to improve the Kinzigtal railway line in the coming year .\n",
      "In particular , safety at railway crossings is to be increased - collisions between trains and other vehicles frequently occur at these across the country .\n",
      "If the municipalities agree to the reconstruction measures , they will be required to contribute one third of the costs , with the remainder divided between Deutsche Bahn and the Federal Government .\n",
      "Schiltach &apos;s town master mason , Roland Grießhaber , explained the peculiarities of the &quot; Am Hirschen &quot; railway crossing to the Town Council .\n",
      "At the crossing , the town is planning to increase the height of the mouth of the tunnel to the west of the railway line .\n",
      "Larger vehicles , for example those that transport long logs , would be able to wait there in the event of oncoming traffic , without having to block the railway line .\n",
      "Grießhaber therefore suggested that a required supporting wall be constructed in such a way that the town could in due course widen the adjoining street in order to guarantee the smooth flow of traffic .\n",
      "This was the subject of controversial discussion in the Town Council , as some council members cast doubt over the need to widen the road: Thomas Kipp summarised the perspective of the critics with this statement: &quot; Do we have to hand over so much money on account of so few vehicles ? &quot;\n",
      "Mayor Thomas Haas retorted: The &quot; Hirschen &quot; railway crossing is used regularly for the transportation of long logs .\n",
      "Even wood from the &quot; Kuhbach &quot; area is occasionally transported via this route , as the vehicles , which measure 20 metres in length , would not be able to use the route via the Häberles Bridge , as they would not be able to make the turn on the Hauptstrasse .\n",
      "Furthermore , when the Hauptstrasse is blocked , the route would also serve as a bypass for those vehicles that are not permitted to use the tunnel , argued Haas .\n",
      "Given that it is likely that the Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnel will have to be reconstructed and renovated , as is currently the case in Wolfach , the &quot; Am Hirschen &quot; railway crossing may become of major traffic significance for a longer period of time .\n",
      "The councillors agreed to have an investigation conducted as to what costs the planned widening of the road would incur .\n",
      "Nevertheless , the reconstruction of the railway crossing was consented to by a majority , on the provision that the required supporting wall be built in such a way that the town could , if required , extend the connecting road in the &quot; Bahnhofstraße &quot; direction to around 5.5 metres to accommodate oncoming traffic .\n",
      "The reconstruction of the railway crossing at the Trautwein tannery could , on the other hand , bring with it an entirely different problem with regard to access to the steep &quot; Geroltzhäuser Weg &quot; .\n",
      "The Administrative Department had Deutsche Bahn &apos;s reconstruction plans investigated by the Breinlinger Engineering Office , as they had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg will be straightforward .\n",
      "The investigation came to the conclusion that it could not be ruled out that the inclination of the road could result in longer vehicles becoming stuck .\n",
      "The town , as the authority responsible for road construction , would then bear responsibility for this .\n",
      "The reconstruction could therefore result in liability disputes .\n",
      "Because both the transportation of wood and turning are both possible as things are , the reconstruction of the railway crossing should not be consented to , argued Haas .\n",
      "At this point , the risk of a train collision with a vehicle positioned on the crossing is considerably lower than at other railway crossings , on account of the fact that there is a midpoint from which there is a good line of sight , directly alongside the stopping point .\n",
      "The trains themselves , coming from the central station , must also be sufficiently slowed down so that there is no threat of collision .\n",
      "According to the councillors , the reconstruction of this railway line was rejected by a majority , as the town of Schiltach would &quot; bear the brunt of the cost &quot; for the problem of vehicles becoming stuck , since the Deutsche Bahn would be able to deny any responsibility following the completion of the construction work .\n",
      "The committee considers the reconstruction of the &quot; Vor Heubach &quot; and &apos; Vor Kuhbach &quot; railway crossings , for which the crossing agreements have already been reached with Deutsche Bahn , to be unproblematic .\n",

      "&quot; Back in the middle of the 20th century , it was called a &apos; psychiatric emergency , &apos; &quot; said Drescher .\n",
      "When these kids were born , you didn &apos;t call the psychiatrist , you called a surgeon .\n",
      "The prevailing theory on how to treat children with ambiguous genitalia was put forward by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University , who held that gender was malleable .\n",
      "He coined the term &quot; gender identity &quot; and argued that social and environmental cues -- how parents raised a child -- interacted with a child &apos;s genes and hormones to shape whether the person identified as male or female .\n",
      "But in one 1966 case , known as &quot; John / Joan , &quot; his theories became controversial .\n",
      "He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been severed in a botched circumcision to have the child fully castrated , removing his testicles , as well , and to raise him as a girl .\n",

      "The tour begins in a somewhat unspectacular fashion: &quot; We begin in the underground car park , &quot; says Schulze .\n",
      "In the 1970s , the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city , and therefore the only sections of the old city wall that remain are those that were not too tall .\n",
      "The majority of the users of the parking garage therefore now hurry past the Roman relics and simply drop off their car .\n",
      "However , anyone who takes a closer look on parking level D2 will discover an archaeological site , cordoned off by metal railings .\n",
      "Ruins measuring five metres tall , made from stones around the size of the palm of your hand , are waiting to be discovered .\n",
      "&quot; These are remnants of the Roman city wall , which was built in the second half of the first century A.D , &quot; explains Schulze .\n",
      "Before returning to daylight , Schulze has participants take a glance into a dark , 15-metre shaft on the upper parking level .\n",
      "This is the well of the old cathedral , which is barely noticed at all these days .\n",

      "Mr Hare , who started with the YMCA when he was 21 , conceded management &quot; from myself down &quot; failed by recruiting Lord and failed to make sure staff were clear about their obligations to report child safe policy breaches .\n",
      "Earlier this year Lord was convicted for sexual offences against 12 boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA .\n",

      "The CEO said he did not accept staff &apos;s evidence that they were uncomfortable with reporting upwards to their managers .\n",
      "Rather , he said , their friendships with Lord clouded their judgements about reporting him .\n",
      "Mr Hare said he had provided his view to the YMCA NSW board that the lesson for the organisation from the &quot; Jonathan Lord incident &quot; was &quot; not about reporting &quot; by staff , and the board agreed with him .\n",
      "Mr Hare said the decision to get staff to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the allegations emerged was made by YMCA general manager of children &apos;s services Liam Whitley .\n",
      "He said it was intended to avoid contamination of evidence but was &quot; overzealous &quot; and poorly executed .\n",

      "Cardinals are the highest-ranking clergy in the Catholic Church below the pope , and they &apos;re the ones who elect popes , so Francis will be appointing his first group of men who will ultimately help choose his successor .\n",

      "However , once a cardinal reaches 80 he is no longer permitted to participate in the election of a pope -- this falls to a group of 120 &quot; cardinal electors . &quot;\n",
      "In a statement announcing the news , Father Federico Lombardi , a Vatican spokesman , said a meeting of all the existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony to elevate the new cardinals , known as a consistory .\n",
      "&quot; Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convoke February &apos;s consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world , &quot; Lombardi said .\n",
      "Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February , the number of cardinal electors was likely to have dropped .\n",
      "He said usually a pope would name as many cardinals as was needed to raise the number of cardinal electors back to 120 and as many cardinals aged over 80 as he wanted .\n",
      "Next year &apos;s consistory would be significant because it would be the first since Francis was elected in March this year , Valero said .\n",
      "At the moment there is a sort of bias towards Europe and especially towards Italy .\n",
      "&quot; It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will nominate cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance , &quot; he said .\n",
      "Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America , but they have a tiny number of cardinals .\n",
      "The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals , a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with looking into ways to reform the church .\n",
      "In the past the Pope decided everything on his own .\n",
      "&quot; Now Francis has selected these eight cardinals to help him , &quot; Valero said .\n",
      "He said it was &quot; quite possible &quot; that Francis would ask the cardinals for advice .\n",
      "But we &apos;ve not been in that situation before -- it &apos;s all completely new .\n",

      "The historic , one hundred-year-old boundary wall between the old school-yard and Kirchstrasse is in need of renovation , primarily as a result of water and frost damage , on account of the lack of drainage , and is leaning forwards .\n",
      "Deep cracks in a number of individual stones testify to the weather damage , however , at present the wall is not in danger of collapse .\n",
      "A secure wall is essential for a school yard that is used by pupils , and this is the purpose of the current fortification work .\n",
      "The school yard renovation was originally planned back in 2008 / 2009 , however , high unplanned expenses meant that the work had to be pushed back .\n",
      "The Regional Memorial Authority will have a major say in the historic school wall renovation , which has even been used for filming .\n",

      "It is no surprise that the idea appeals to urban liberals , as the taxes could be rigged to change driving patterns in ways that could help reduce congestion and greenhouse gases , for example .\n",
      "California planners are looking to the system as they devise strategies to meet the goals laid out in the state &apos;s ambitious global warming laws .\n",
      "But Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa .), chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has said he , too , sees it as the most viable long-term alternative .\n",
      "The free marketeers at the Reason Foundation are also fond of having drivers pay per mile .\n",
      "&quot; This is not just a tax going into a black hole , &quot; said Adrian Moore , vice president of policy at Reason .\n",
      "People are paying more directly into what they are getting .\n",
      "The movement is also bolstered by two former U.S. Transportation secretaries , who in a 2011 report urged Congress to move in the pay-per-mile direction .\n",
      "The U.S. Senate approved a $ 90-million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars .\n",
      "But the House leadership killed the proposal , acting on concerns of rural lawmakers representing constituents whose daily lives often involve logging lots of miles to get to work or into town .\n",
      "Several states and cities are nonetheless moving ahead on their own .\n",
      "The most eager is Oregon , which is enlisting 5,000 drivers in the country &apos;s biggest experiment .\n",
      "Those drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of gas taxes to the state .\n",
      "Nevada has already completed a pilot .\n",
      "New York City is looking into one .\n",
      "Illinois is trying it on a limited basis with trucks .\n",
      "And the I-95 Coalition , which includes 17 state transportation departments along the Eastern Seaboard (including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia and Florida), is studying how they could go about implementing the change .\n",
      "The concept is not a universal hit .\n",
      "In Nevada , where about 50 volunteers &apos; cars were equipped with the devices not long ago , drivers were uneasy about the government being able to monitor their every move .\n",
      "&quot; Concerns about Big Brother and those sorts of things were a major problem , &quot; said Alauddin Khan , who directs strategic and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation .\n",
      "It was not something people wanted .\n",
      "As the trial got underway , the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: &quot; It would be fairly easy to turn these devices into full-fledged tracking devices . &quot;\n",
      "There is no need to build an enormous , unwieldy technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of individuals &apos; everyday comings and goings .\n",
      "Nevada is among several states now scrambling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to keep track of how many miles a car is being driven , but not exactly where and at what time .\n",
      "If you can do that , Khan said , the public gets more comfortable .\n",
      "The hunt for that technology has led some state agencies to a small California startup called True Mileage .\n",
      "The firm was not originally in the business of helping states tax drivers .\n",
      "It was seeking to break into an emerging market in auto insurance , in which drivers would pay based on their mileage .\n",
      "But the devices it is testing appeal to highway planners because they don &apos;t use GPS and deliver a limited amount of information , uploaded periodically by modem .\n",
      "&quot; People will be more willing to do this if you do not track their speed and you do not track their location , &quot; said Ryan Morrison , chief executive of True Mileage .\n",
      "There have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs .\n",
      "There are a lot less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this .\n",
      "In Oregon , planners are experimenting with giving drivers different choices .\n",
      "They can choose a device with or without GPS .\n",
      "Or they can choose not to have a device at all , opting instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles driven by all state residents .\n",
      "Other places are hoping to sell the concept to a wary public by having the devices do more , not less .\n",
      "In New York City , transportation officials are seeking to develop a taxing device that would also be equipped to pay parking meter fees , provide &quot; pay-as-you-drive &quot; insurance , and create a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic .\n",
      "&quot; Motorists would be attracted to participate because of the value of the benefits it offers to them , &quot; says a city planning document .\n",
      "Some transportation planners , though , wonder if all the talk about paying by the mile is just a giant distraction .\n",
      "At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area , officials say Congress could very simply deal with the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising gas taxes .\n",
      "An extra one-time or annual levy could be imposed on drivers of hybrids and others whose vehicles don &apos;t use much gas , so they pay their fair share .\n",
      "&quot; There is no need for radical surgery when all you need to do is take an aspirin , &quot; said Randy Rentschler , the commission &apos;s director of legislation and public affairs .\n",
      "If we do this , hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a host of other things .\n",

      "Borussia Dortmund announced that there would be serious consequences .\n",
      "Before Friday &apos;s Bundesliga match against VfB Stuttgart , the &apos; Ultras &apos; responded with silence - initially .\n",
      "It was an unusual , almost ghostly atmosphere that the fans created until shortly before the kick-off of the Bundesliga match between the German runners-up Borussia Dortmend and VfB Stuttgart , in the Signal Iduna Park .\n",
      "It was mainly the chants of away fans that could be heard .\n",
      "The south stand , on the other hand , where the most loyal - and the loudest - of BVB fans stand , was initially unusually quiet: No singing and no battle cries .\n",
      "The &apos; Capo &apos;s &apos; podium , the individual who usually coordinates the unison chants , remained empty .\n",
      "And right at the front , on the stand , a single large flag with the text &quot; Stadium Ban Section &quot; blew in the wind .\n",
      "Only when goalkeeper , Roman Weidenfeller , was the first BVB player to step onto the field , did cheers briefly erupt , as is usually the case .\n",
      "When his team mates followed , there was loud singing and scarves were waving - but by no means everywhere .\n",
      "In the central blocks of the south stand , blocks 12 and 13 , nothing moved .\n",
      "Even stadium announcer , Norbert Dickel , speaking once again of the successful results in recent days - the derby victory , the win against Arsenal , the contract extension of coach Jörgen klopp - did not raise spirits .\n",
      "Just five minutes before kick-off , the Capo climbed onto his podium - and the tension that had been almost tangible up until that point , lifted with a large shout , as Dickel asked for a shout from each section of fans as usual .\n",
      "As always , the south stand was left until the end , and finally the stand resumed its usual role as the loudest section of the stadium .\n",
      "And as soon as the vociferous request for &quot; derby winners stand up &quot; came from the south stand upon kick-off , everything was back to normal .\n",
      "The previous silence was indeed a reaction to the events of previous days .\n",
      "Immediately before the local district derby against FC Schalke 04 , some of the travelling BVB fans fired flares into the crowds of spectators and onto the pitch - and in so doing almost hit goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller .\n",
      "The kick-off was delayed on account of the chaotic scenes ,\n",
      "As a result , BVB Chairman Hans Joachim Watzke had invited the heads of the Dortmund Ultras fan group to his office - and if Watzke &apos;s words are to be believed , this was a rather uncomfortable meeting for the fan representatives .\n",
      "&quot; There will be massive impact for the entire Ultra movement , &quot; announced the BVB Chairman on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt .\n",
      "As an immediate measure , Watzke prohibited the Ultras from organising choreography for the home match against VfB Stuttgart .\n",
      "&quot; I have banned it , &quot; he explained .\n",
      "We cannot ignore the zero tolerance policy regarding pyrotechnics in Saxony .\n",
      "In addition , the Ultras were given the option of several different punishments - they now have until Tuesday to decide which one to accept .\n",
      "Otherwise BVB will impose a sanction by the end of next week , said Watzke .\n",
      "&quot; It will be severe , &quot; assured Watzke .\n",

      "Distant planets , gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that are to be launched in the coming years .\n",
      "There were 30 proposals to choose from , five of which are still in the running .\n",
      "Distant worlds .\n",
      "Astronomers have already found more than 1,000 planets near other stars .\n",
      "Whether or not life exists on at least some of these , no-one knows .\n",
      "The choice is a difficult one: Should we search for gravitational waves ?\n",
      "Or instead conduct research into the origin of the cosmos ?\n",
      "Or search for planets similar to the Earth and thus perhaps discover extraterrestrial life ?\n",
      "These are the questions currently being asked by those responsible at the European Space Agency , ESA .\n",
      "For their &quot; Cosmic Vision &quot; programme , they are looking for ideas for two major space projects , which should greatly advance research .\n",
      "The budget for &quot; L-Missions &quot; such as this lies at around one billion Euro .\n",
      "The projects are planned to start in 2028 and 2034 .\n",
      "At the beginning of September , the elite in the field of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions .\n",
      "30 ideas were up for debate , of which five have now made it onto the short list .\n",
      "Numerous panels are assessing the proposals , posing questions to the researchers .\n",
      "Over the coming days , a final decision is to be made by the Scientific Programme Committee .\n",
      "In total , four main questions were chosen by the ESA , to which the missions of the &quot; Cosmic Vision &quot; programme , initiated in 2007 , are to find the answers .\n",
      "What are the conditions required for the formation of planets and life ?\n",
      "The precise processes for the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus the formation of the planets that orbit these stars - lie in proverbial darkness .\n",
      "A large infra-red telescope in space could penetrate this darkness .\n",
      "And if a star has planets , under what circumstances can life exist there ?\n",
      "In order to pursue this question , the &quot; Cheops &quot; space telescope is to be launched in 2017 , with which 500 known planetary systems in proximity to us will be investigated in greater detail .\n",
      "The possibilities are , however , limited - Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million Euro .\n",
      "With larger instruments , astronomers could map planets similar to Earth and even analyse the composition of their atmospheres , and thus search for &quot; biomarkers &quot;: gases that serve as an indicator for biological activity .\n",
      "How does the solar system function ?\n",
      "This question should also provide information regarding the preconditions for the origins of life .\n",
      "The magnetic activity of a star , the interaction of its magnetic field and the emitted particle radiation play an important role .\n",
      "It is possible to investigate these processes in our solar system , to serve as an example to be applied elsewhere .\n",
      "With the &quot; Solar Orbiter &quot; , the ESA has already approved an M-class mission (for which the budget stands at around half a million Euro) to address this matter .\n",
      "The probe is to be launched in 2017 and will closely observe the surface and activity of the sun .\n",
      "Jupiter and its moons are also of great interest to the researchers .\n",
      "They want to find our what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system .\n",
      "The ESA is planning that the first of the total of three L-Missions of the &quot; Cosmic Vision &quot; programme will address this subject .\n",
      "The &quot; Juice &quot; (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) probe is planned to begin its journey in 2022 .\n",
      "Eight years later it will reach Jupiter and will investigate the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons Europa , Callisto and Ganymede .\n",
      "What are the basic physical laws of the Universe ?\n",
      "Outer space offers many possibilities for studying substances under extreme conditions and thus examining whether the laws of nature , as known to us , are still valid there .\n",
      "There may also be deviations that could show physicians the path to a new theory , under the umbrella of which all known natural laws could be united .\n",
      "How did the universe come about and what does it consist of ?\n",
      "13.7 billion years ago , our cosmos was created by the Big Bang .\n",
      "Alongside the materials familiar to us , from which stars , planets and life forms such as ourselves are composed , there exists dark matter , the gravitational force of which holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together , and dark energy , the effects of which accelerate the expansion of the universe .\n",
      "Thus far , researchers know neither which physical laws applied in the initial moments after the Big Bang , nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of .\n",
      "With &quot; Euclid &quot; , the ESA has already approved an M-mission , planned to commence in 2020 .\n",
      "With a special telescope , the probe is to examine the distribution of material in the universe across the entire sky , thus enabling conclusions to be drawn regarding the properties of dark matter and dark energy .\n",
      "Proposals that are in the running ...\n",
      "Of the 30 proposals , only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure .\n",
      "The proposal with the best chance of approval as an L-mission , in the opinion of many experts , is &quot; E-Lisa &quot; , a demanding concept that aims to prove the existence of gravitational waves .\n",
      "Many physicians perceive this to entail changes in the structure of space-time , which Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago .\n",
      "To date they have never been proved to exist .\n",
      "The scientists behind the project hope that Elisa could achieve this .\n",
      "The mission involves placing a detector , consisting of two or three probes , in outer space .\n",
      "Unlike systems on Earth , it could also prove gravitational waves created during the Big Bang , and thus provide fresh knowledge regarding the origin of the cosmos .\n",
      "Four other proposals are still competing for the second L-mission place: a large X-ray telescope called &quot; Athena &quot; , which among other things would research black holes , &quot; Icy Planets &quot; , another mission to the outer planets of the solar system , &quot; prism &quot; , a mission for the measurement of cosmic background radiation , and the &quot; Exoplanet Finder &quot; , which would find and investigate planets similar to Earth .\n",
      "Among others , proposals that have already been ruled out include proposals for bringing samples back from Mars , conducting research on the moon , Venus and asteroids , as well as proposals in the area of solar physics .\n",

      "In this sense , this the 2012 budgetary year , can also be recorded as a complete success .\n",
      "This became clear upon presentation of the annual accounts for 2012 .\n",
      "As Andrea Rothmund explained , the administrative budget came in at more than EUR one million higher than originally planned , at around 7.6 million Euro .\n",
      "The administrative budget surplus , at around EUR 1.8 million , also stood at around EUR one million above projections .\n",
      "The surplus is primarily due to higher trade tax income and the local authorities &apos; contribution towards income tax .\n",
      "The capital budget also stood well above the projected values .\n",
      "Instead of the projected EUR 1.5 million Euro , the value for last year was EUR 2.5 million .\n",
      "&quot; This is mainly due to the higher contribution from the administrative budget , &quot; said Rothmund .\n",
      "Because fewer investments were made in the 2012 budgetary year than planned , the reserves also came in higher .\n",
      "In total , they managed to increase the general contingency reserves by around EUR 2.1 million , to a total of EUR 4.9 million .\n",
      "Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and its team for the good work .\n",
      "&quot; A job like this is not something you achieve overnight , &quot; said Gerster in praise of the annual financial statement .\n",

      "It may sound like a paradox , but it is precisely these good figures that could soon work out expensive for the citizens .\n",
      "In the past , a good financial situation meant that the local authorities could do away with high municipal rates .\n",
      "However , according to Gerster , from time to time this has resulted in subsidies being reduced by the state .\n",
      "There are prerequisites that must be fulfilled in order to receive these subsidies from various compensation elements .\n",
      "Among other requirements , the towns and municipalities applying for the subsidies must levy certain municipal rates .\n",

      "Due to the time difference , the pupils had been on the go for almost 24 hours , however , true to the slogan , &quot; the city never sleeps &quot; , the day was rounded off with a trip to Times Square .\n",
      "In spite of a shutdown , they were able to visit the Statue of Liberty on the second day , and climb the statue on foot .\n",
      "They then moved on to the Financial District , via Wall Street , to visit the 9 / 11 memorial .\n",
      "On the third day , the pupils were able to take in an overview of the fascinating city from the viewing platform of the Empire State Building , enjoying the views from a height of 373 metres .\n",
      "They then made their way through the hustle and bustle of the New York streets , via the Rockerfeller Center , to Central Park , which provided the perfect opportunity to rest a while in the Autumn sun .\n",

      "What happens with my e-mail when in transit ?\n",
      "E-mail is short for electronic mail .\n",
      "Are there technical measures to maintain privacy of correspondence , similar to that of the traditional postal service , implemented into the design of this Internet-based service ?\n",
      "When designing the early Internet services , the focus lay on making communication possible .\n",
      "Thus , when developing the underlying technical protocols , no attention was given to creating a stable foundation for the interception-proof exchange of mail .\n",
      "For this reason , a traditional email is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter .\n",
      "When user &quot; Anna &quot; sends an email to &quot; Benni &quot; , are the pair &apos;s computers then directly connected ?\n",
      "Anna &apos;s email program or browser first sends the mail to her service provider &apos;s mail server .\n",
      "If she has a Gmail account , for example , this would be Google .\n",
      "This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses .\n",
      "En route , the mail can pass through any number of other servers on the Internet .\n",
      "Benni can then call up the content from his provider .\n",
      "Are traditional e-mails read by third parties on their journey through the net ?\n",
      "The majority of e-mails are read several times by software robots en route to the recipient .\n",
      "Checks are generally carried out by the sender &apos;s provider as to whether the mail contains malware as an attachment .\n",
      "A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems .\n",
      "In addition , the providers check whether it is nuisance or unwanted spam mail , which are deleted immediately or at least sorted into a spam folder .\n",
      "Do the robots have other tasks ?\n",
      "In the case of systems such as Gmail , the robots also identify the information that Google requires for displaying context-based advertising .\n",
      "If Anna and Benni communicate about their upcoming holiday travels via Gmail , Google can display corresponding links to holiday offers .\n",
      "Do unknown individuals also read the e-mails ?\n",
      "The probability of unauthorised persons reading a mail is extremely low .\n",
      "However , theoretically , it is possible .\n",
      "Within companies , administrators are often able to read electronic mail that is sent .\n",
      "Law enforcement authorities and Secret Services also have legal authorisation to intercept or take note of e-mails .\n",
      "This may include potential illegal spying activities .\n",
      "Is it possible to protect e-mails against being read ?\n",
      "With an encryption using the OpenPGP standard , an e-mail can be effectively protected against being read .\n",
      "With great technical effort , it is also possible to conceal the metadata of email communication so that it is not even possible to tell who is communicating with whom .\n",
      "How important are Yahoo and Google within the e-mail market in Germany ?\n",
      "According to a study conducted by Convios Consulting in August 2013 , among the main mail services in private use , Yahoo and Google play only a minor role .\n",
      "While the number of Yahoo Mail accounts has fallen recently , Google &apos;s Gmail managed to grow considerably .\n",

      "Shortly before the Schänzle roundabout he noticed that was in the left-turn lane going in the direction of Stromeyersdorfstraße and moved across to the right lane .\n",
      "In so doing , he collided with the BMW of a 23-year-old Konstanz resident , travelling in that lane .\n",

      "Using huge mirrors , the residents of a Norwegian village have brought light to their dreary valley .\n",

      "&quot; Finally ! &apos; , raved Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the inaugural ceremony , televised by broadcaster TV2 .\n",
      "Some valley residents lay back on sun loungers , while others safely put on their sunglasses .\n",
      "Up until now , those hungry for sunshine in the winter had to travel to a nearby peak by cable car .\n",
      "Ten years ago , local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal of directing the sun into the valley using mirrors .\n",
      "However , this basic idea had been talked of in the location since 1913 .\n",
      "After several years of debate , the Town Council finally approved the project , which cost 5 million krone (around EUR 615,000).\n",
      "A similar construction has provided sunshine to the Italian alpine resort of Viganella for a number of years .\n",

      "The citizens of Pfullendorf will have to adjust to high electricity costs .\n",
      "As Managing Director of the municipal energy company , Jörg-Arne Bias , confirmed to the SÜDKURIER , families of four in Pfullendorf will be on the receiving end of a price increase of EUR 70 to 90 per year .\n",
      "One major reason for the upcoming price increase is the rise of the so-called EEC Levy from 5.277 to 6.3 Cents per kilowatt hour .\n",
      "This levy will be reset by the four operators of the large power grids , in October of each year .\n",
      "They estimate the additional costs they will incur as a result of the &quot; energy turnaround &quot; , which they will be able to recover by means of a levy on the price of electricity .\n",
      "The Pfullendorf municipal energy company forms the last link in this chain .\n",
      "In its projections , the supervisory council of the energy company even assumed a levy higher than that reported by Jörg-Arne Bias .\n",
      "The specific figures must now be calculated before the municipal energy cmpany can inform its customers of the precise price increase next week .\n",
      "&quot; We are working on the assumption of an increase of 1 cent plus x , &quot; said Bias , with the figure likely to be closer to 2 cents .\n",

      "Now the New Express is to undergo &quot; full rectification , &quot; the regulator said .\n",
      "The &quot; rectification &quot; order came from the Guangdong Administration of Press and Publication , Radio , Film and Television .\n",
      "A preliminary investigation showed that Yangcheng Evening News Group &apos;s New Express had published several untrue reports about listed company Zoomlion in the period of September 2012 to August 2013 .\n",

      "It had also &quot; instructed Yangcheng Evening News Group to undertake a complete rectification of New Express , and recommended they investigate the relevant responsible persons at New Express and immediately revise New Express &apos;s leadership team . &quot;\n",
      "Mr Chen wrote several articles for the New Express alleging financial irregularities at a construction-equipment company called Zoomlion .\n",

      "The contact loop on the road does not react , or the light itself is defective .\n",
      "What should you do - drive through on red ?\n",
      "If an affected person has waited for a sufficiently long period of time at a red light , and provided the crossing is clear , they can drive on , explained Stuttgart-based lawyer Ralf Becker in &quot; Motorrad &quot; (Motorcycle) magazine .\n",
      "The waiting time must , however , be &quot; appropriate &quot; , which can be interpreted differently on a case-to-case basis .\n",

      "Speaking to an open government conference in London via video link , Mr Kerry said: &quot; There is no question that the President and I and others in government have actually learned of some things that had been happening on an automatic pilot because the ability has been there , going back to World War Two and to the very difficult years of the Cold War , and then , of course , 9 / 11 . &quot;\n",

      "New anti-nicotine vaccine could take the pleasure out of smoking\n",
      "Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could take the pleasure out of smoking a cigarette .\n",
      "A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice against nicotine addiction for life .\n",
      "Further tests are needed before starting human trials , which would take several years , but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the early signs are good .\n",
      "&quot; We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to stop , exhausting all the methods on the market today , but find their nicotine addiction to be strong enough to overcome these current approaches , &quot; Prof Cornell said .\n",
      "The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been engineered to carry the genetic information to make anti-nicotine antibodies .\n",
      "The virus selectively infects liver cells , which then start to make a steady stream of the antibodies .\n",
      "The antibodies hunt down any nicotine molecules in the bloodstream , neutralising them before they reached the brain , preventing a smoker from getting a nicotine hit .\n",
      "In tests , vaccinated mice who were subsequently given nicotine continued with their normal activity .\n",
      "But mice who had not been given the vaccine &quot; chilled out , &quot; say the researchers , a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains .\n",
      "The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine .\n",
      "Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies .\n",
      "The jabs had to be given so frequently to keep antibody levels topped up that they proved expensive and impractical .\n",
      "But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be far lower , because it turns liver cells into antibody factories .\n",
      "Prof Crystal said that if a future human vaccine was completely safe it could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette , preventing nicotine addiction .\n",
      "But more likely it would be used by smokers to quit .\n",
      "&quot; They will know if they start smoking again , they will receive no pleasure from it due to the nicotine vaccine , and that can help them kick the habit , &quot; he said .\n",
      "British scientists said the results were interesting but warned far more research was needed .\n",

      "&quot; We aspire to a better tomorrow , a new Egypt and a second republic , &quot; Morsi said during a solemn ceremony shown live on state television .\n",
      "&quot; Today , the Egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life - absolute freedom , a genuine democracy and stability , &quot; said Morsi , a 60-year-old US-trained engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group that has spent most of the 84 years since its inception as an outlawed organisation harshly targeted by successive governments .\n",
      "Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building as Morsi arrived shortly after 11am local time in a small motorcade .\n",
      "Only several hundred supporters gathered outside the court to cheer the new president and , in a departure from the presidential pomp of the Mubarak years , traffic was only briefly halted to allow his motorcade through on the usually busy road linking the city centre with its southern suburbs .\n",
      "Derided as the Brotherhood &apos;s uncharismatic &quot; spare tyre , &quot; his personal prestige has surged since his victory and his delivery of a Friday speech that tried to present him as a candidate not just of Islamists but of all those who want to complete the work of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak .\n",
      "&quot; Egypt today is a civil , national , constitutional and modern state , &quot; Morsi , wearing a blue business suit and a red tie , told the judges in the wood-panelled chamber where he took the oath of office .\n",

      "Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square , birthplace of the uprising that ended Mubarak &apos;s authoritarian rule last year , and vowed to reclaim presidential powers stripped from his office by the military council that took over from the ousted leader .\n",
      "But by agreeing to take the official oath before the court , rather than before parliament as is customary , he is bowing to the military &apos;s will in an indication that the contest for power will continue .\n",

      "Once a psychiatric expert had cast considerable doubt on him suffering from any psychiatric condition , and thus on his limited culpability , the 33-year-old made a full confession .\n",

      "&quot; Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing and we have no immediate plans to change that , &quot; it said .\n",
      "The FAA ruling applies to American airlines .\n",
      "However , we are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers and we will certainly be taking a close look at the FAA &apos;s decision and the reasons behind it .\n",
      "For US carriers , the impact of the ruling will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet .\n",
      "Carriers will need to prove their planes can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices as well as revise manuals , training materials , carry-on baggage programs and passenger briefings .\n",
      "&quot; Once an airline verifies the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use handheld , lightweight electronic devices such as tablets , e-readers , and smartphones-at all altitudes , &quot; the FAA said .\n",
      "In rare instances of low visibility , the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during landing .\n",
      "The group also recommended that heavier devices should be safely stowed under seats or in overhead bins during take-off and landing .\n",

      "The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is a significant milestone in an ambitious timeline that aims to destroy all of Damascus &apos; chemical weapons by mid-2014 .\n",
      "Destruction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .\n",
      "However , Damascus still has to start destroying existing weapons and stockpiles .\n",
      "The country is believed to have around 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin .\n",

      "True , the Strathclyde paper pointed out the possible economic benefits of freer movement with the rest of Europe , though - predictably - that did not figure in the headlines .\n",
      "Nor did anyone point out that the EU member states spend much of their time bending their formal rules if it suits them .\n",

      "And one that is so long in the tooth it has become fossilised: I first heard the &quot; independence means passport controls &quot; canard at least 40 years ago .\n",

      "There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe .\n",
      "However , the current economic crisis has proved a watershed .\n",
      "The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank , coupled with the straitjacket imposed on national economies through adherence to the common currency , has led many people to think Project Europe has gone too far .\n",
      "The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits - that was true only of Greece .\n",
      "Rather , the euro system locked in its members at exchange rates favourable to German exporters - something German politicians want to keep .\n",
      "Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation , southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany .\n",

      "As a result of &quot; green &quot; energy policies imposed by Brussels - code for subsidising French and German energy firms at the consumer &apos;s expense - European industry pays twice as much for electricity , and four times as much for gas , as in the United States .\n",

      "As a result , revolt is brewing , especially in France , once the EU &apos;s main cheerleader .\n",
      "After the war , the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check , and to give Paris equal billing in the world with Washington .\n",

      "The Ecumenical Discussion Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant churches in Salem , the Salem Castle and the Lake Constance District Cultural Office .\n",
      "At the forum , Johanna Rahner wants to address the question of how people today view the &quot; end times &quot; after death .\n",
      "While people in past centuries were overly conscious of it , focusing on the pictures of heaven and hell &quot; that up until now have defined our ideas &quot; , contemporary prophetic teaching on the hope of consummation is characterised more by a certain bashfulness , or even speechlessness .\n",
      "&quot; The greater hope has been well and truly cast out of Christians by religious critics , &quot; said the speaker .\n",
      "They have &quot; provided us with so many question marks , that we seem to have lost our exclamation marks &quot; .\n",
      "Johanna Rahner continued: &quot; However , the crucial challenge to this remains fear of death &quot; .\n",

      "With Burfien , the regional church has for first time commissioned a minister to work full time , endeavouring to inspire young people to study theology .\n",
      "At present , fewer and fewer young people are deciding to study theology after their Abitur examinations (equivalent to A levels).\n",
      "Burfien puts this down to the process of secularisation: &quot; God &apos;s voice is quiet , the world is loud &quot; .\n",

      "It is not yet clear how the new owner will use the former Kindergarten .\n",
      "The Mayor considers it the right decision that Winterlingen has handed over responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter , and thus will no longer have to pay for the upkeep of the building , such as heating it , tending to the garden and clearing the pavement .\n",

      "A few chips , a coke , a burger - and then straight home and into bed !\n",
      "However , on the way home the clear differences between me and other hungry clubbers become evident .\n",
      "What is wrong with people who continually throw their fast food bags out of the car window ? !\n",
      "At the weekend in particular , discarded paper bags can be found at the side of the road and in car parks .\n",
      "&quot; Why is this ? &quot; I ask myself .\n",
      "Are the people too stupid to take their bags home or throw them into the nearest rubbish bin ?\n",
      "After all , waste paper does more than spoil the landscape .\n",
      "Bags have also been seen covering transport facilities such as crash barriers , thus causing accidents .\n",
      "However , the so-called &quot; throwaway society &quot; does not think about such things . They probably do not even know what the term even means .\n",
      "If you are often out and about in the evening , more often than not with several people in the car , you will know what a back seat can look like after having partied through the night: clothes , bottles and other rubbish begin to pile up .\n",
      "A few bags won &apos;t make much of a difference there - in contrast to on the street where no-one wants to trample through other peoples &apos; leftover food .\n",

      "FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but not make cell phone calls)\n",
      "Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices gate-to-gate to read , work , play games , watch movies and listen to music - but not talk on their cellphones - under much-anticipated new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration .\n",
      "But passengers shouldn &apos;t expect changes to happen immediately .\n",
      "How fast the change is implemented will vary by the airline , FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a news conference .\n",
      "Airlines will have to show the FAA how their airplanes meet the new guidelines and that they &apos;ve updating their flight crew training manuals and rules for stowing devices to reflect the new guidelines .\n",
      "The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes .\n",
      "Delta and JetBlue were among the airliners who have already submitted plans .\n",
      "&quot; Depending on the condition of the plan , we could approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon , &quot; the FAA said in a statement .\n",
      "Currently , passengers are required to turn off their smartphones , tablets and other devices once a plane &apos;s door closes .\n",
      "They &apos;re not supposed to restart them until the planes reach 10,000 feet and the captain gives the go-ahead .\n",
      "Passengers are supposed to turn their devices off again as the plane descends to land and not restart them until the plane is on the ground .\n",
      "Under the new guidelines , airlines whose planes are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use the devices during takeoffs , landings and taxiing , the FAA said .\n",
      "Most new airliners and other planes that have been modified so that passengers can use Wifi at higher altitudes are expected to meet the criteria .\n",
      "Laura Glading , president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants , welcomed the changes .\n",
      "&quot; Once the new policy is safely implemented - and we &apos;re going to work closely with the carrier to do that - it will be a win-win , &quot; Glading said in a statement .\n",
      "We &apos;re frankly tired of feeling like &apos; hall monitors &apos; when it comes to this issue .\n",
      "But connecting to the Internet to surf , exchange emails , text or download data will still be prohibited below 10,000 feet , the agency said .\n",
      "Passengers will be told to switch their smartphones , tablets and other devices to airplane mode .\n",
      "So , still no Words With Friends , the online Scrabble-type game that actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone in 2011 when he was famously booted off an American Airlines jet for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the gate .\n",
      "And heavier devices such as laptops will continue to have to be stowed because of concern they might injure someone if they go flying around the cabin .\n",
      "In-flight cellphone calls also will continue to be prohibited .\n",
      "Regulatory authority over phone calls belongs to the Federal Communications Commission , not the FAA .\n",
      "FAA may lift ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing\n",
      "Last month , National Transportation Safety Board Mark Rosenker , a CBS News national transportation safety expert , said that cell phones are still considered a risk .\n",
      "&quot; Cell phones , that really is an issue , not just because potentially it could create interference with navigational devices , but we do know , according to the FCC , that it could interfere with cell phone towers when they &apos;re in the air , &quot; Rosenker said .\n",
      "An industry advisory committee created by the FAA to examine the issue recommended last month that the government permit greater use of personal electronic devices .\n",
      "Pressure has been building on the FAA in recent years to ease restrictions on their use .\n",
      "Critics such as Sen. Claire McCaskill , D-Mo . , contend there is no valid safety reason for the prohibitions .\n",
      "The restrictions have also become increasingly difficult to enforce as use of the devices has become ubiquitous .\n",
      "Some studies indicate as many as a third of passengers forget or ignore directions to turn off their devices .\n",
      "The FAA began restricting passengers &apos; use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communications equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios , the high-tech gadgets of their day .\n",
      "New airliners are far more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference .\n",
      "Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi use at cruising altitudes to passengers for several years .\n",
      "Planes modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference .\n",
      "The vast majority of airliners should qualify for greater electronic device use under the new guidelines , Huerta said .\n",
      "Today &apos;s electronic devices generally emit much lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices .\n",
      "E-readers , for example , emit only minimal transmissions when turning a page .\n",
      "But transmissions are stronger when devices are downloading or sending data .\n",
      "Among those pressing for a relaxation of restrictions on passengers &apos; use of the devices has been Amazon.com.\n",
      "In 2011 , company officials loaded an airliner full of their Kindle e-readers and flew it around to test for problems but found none .\n",
      "FAA advisory committee members expressed mixed feelings about whether use of the devices presents any risk .\n",
      "Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believes interference from the devices is genuine even if the risk is minimal .\n",
      "Other committee members said there are only anecdotal reports from pilots to support that the devices can interfere with aircraft systems , and most of those reports are very old .\n",
      "However , the committee recommended the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to shut off devices during instrument landings in low visibility .\n",
      "A travel industry group welcomed the changes , calling them common-sense accommodations for a traveling public now bristling with technology .\n",
      "&quot; We &apos;re pleased the FAA recognizes that an enjoyable passenger experience is not incompatible with safety and security , &quot; said Roger Dow , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association .\n",
